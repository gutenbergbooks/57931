  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The issues of the conflict that forms the topic of
this little volume are bound inevitably to influence
the future of the civilized world for many years.
Dr. Asakawa presents them with a logical thoroughness
that reminds us of the military operations of
his countrymen now in evidence elsewhere, and recalls
very pleasantly to my own mind the sane and
accurate character of his scholastic work while a
student at Yale. It is the sort of presentation which
a great subject needs. It is content with a simple
statement of fact and inference. It is convincing
because of its brevity and restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>The generous and almost passionate sympathy of
our countrymen for Japan in this crisis of her career
has aroused some speculation and surprise even
amongst ourselves. The emotion is, doubtless, the
outcome of complex causes, but this much is obvious
at present: the past half-century has brought both
America and Japan through experiences strikingly
similar, and their establishment at the same moment
as new world Powers has afforded both the same
view of their older competitors for first rank among
nations. Both have earned their centralized and
effective governments after the throes of civil war;
both have built navies and expanded their foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>commerce; both have arrested the belated and
rather contemptuous attention of Europe by success
in foreign wars. No state of Christendom can appreciate
so well as America the vexation of enduring
for generations the presumption or the patronage
of those European courts who have themselves
been free for less than a century from the bonds
that Napoleon put upon the entire Continental
group; and Japan has suffered under the same observance.
With the acknowledgment of the existence
of these two Powers of the first class on either
shore of the Pacific, the bottom drops out of that
system whereon was based the diplomacy of nineteenth-century
Europe, and the jealousy with which
they are both regarded establishes a certain <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</span></i>
between the two newly arrived nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attitude of the American people does not
appear to me to be greatly influenced by prejudice
against Russia. It is likely, indeed, that we had
less to fear directly from the ambition of the Great
Colossus than any other state. Yet we have been
among the first to discern that Japan is doing the
world’s work if, by reducing the pressure of Russia’s
assault upon Eastern Asia, she removes China
in the crisis of her awakening from the list of those
derelict states whose present decrepitude offers
such deplorable temptation to the military nations
of the West. There would seem to be fresh need,
moreover, of convincing modern statesmen that a
policy of conducting diplomatic intercourse by means
of tergiversation and lies is unprofitable in the long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>run, and therefore unjustified by the most cynical
school of political ethics. Without debating the
righteousness of her pretensions, it is obvious that
Russia cannot proceed further in her headway without
materially affecting the legitimate ambitions of
other peoples of proved vitality, nor can her characteristic
diplomacy secure success without debauching
the political morality of Christendom. While
apprehension of Russian aims need not involve dislike
of the Russian people, we have an abiding idea
in this country that both alike lie under a necessity
of chastisement, and that Japan, as the only nation
now really at home on the Pacific, is the hand to
hold the rod.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion—if I may be allowed to extend
these reflections a little further—the situation
before us suggests the possibility that Asia may at
this moment be passing the threshold of a renascence
similar to that which awakened Europe at
the opening of the sixteenth century from the lethargy
of her dark ages. As the able editor of the
<cite>North China Herald</cite> has observed, native Asia from
Korea to Siam is to-day no more deeply immersed
in the mire of poverty, ignorance, and superstition
than was Europe in the Middle Ages, nor was the
task of relief and enlightenment less hopeless to
human agencies then than now. Yet with the Age
of Discoveries came not only new worlds and new
paths of commerce, but the end of the tyrannies of
scholasticism, the church, and the despot. Within
a century were laid all the foundations of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>political and intellectual institutions that distinguish
Europe and her children to-day. A like reconstruction
may be effected in Asia during the century
just begun. The parallel is not altogether inadmissible,
and it may be pushed even further. For as
the newly awakened Europe of the sixteenth century
developed one monster Power whose aggrandizement
threatened the liberties of all the rest, so
has the present era brought forth a monster fearful
in the same fashion to Asia. It was England, a
naval folk and a new Power, that struck at Spain
three centuries ago, and by that brave adventure
not only won wealth and prestige for herself, but
rid Europe of a great menace. It is Japan, also a
naval race and a new—so far as Continental history
is concerned—that strikes at Russia and hopes by
her success both to avert the undoing of the ancient
states about her and to establish herself as mistress
in her own waters. Confident in their understanding
of their great mission, we of America may rightfully
bid the dazed Asiatic seek his salvation from the
children of the Rising Sun, and declare in the
Sibylline utterance of the Psalmist, “The dew of
thy birth is of the womb of the morning.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This is an attempt to present in a verifiable form
some of the issues and the historical causes of the
war now waged between Russia and Japan. Powerfully
as it appeals to me, I would not have discussed
a subject so strange to the proper sphere of
my investigation, had it not been for the fact that
no one else has, so far as I am aware, undertaken
the task in the same spirit in which I have endeavored
to write these pages. Although I deeply regret
that I do not read the Russian language and
cannot do full justice to the Russian side of the
question, the impartial reader will observe, I trust,
that this work is neither a plea for the one side nor
a condemnation of the other, but a mere exposition
of the subject-matter as I comprehend it. When the
author offers what he considers a natural explanation
of a question, the reader should not read into
it a moral judgment. Indeed, I earnestly wish that
the kind reader would thrash out of these pages
every grain of real prejudice. Nor can I welcome
a greater favor from any person than a more complete
and just statement of Russia’s case than I
have been able to make. After having said so
much, it is unnecessary to tell the reader how, when
the substance of the introductory chapter to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>volume was published last May in the <cite>Yale
Review</cite>, some of its critics ascribed to the writer
motives utterly foreign to himself. One of those
alleged motives was that I had sought to prove
that the American trading interest in Manchuria
and Korea would be better served by a final victory
of Japan than by that of Russia. I neither proved
nor disproved such a theme, but I did state that
Japan’s interest demanded the maintenance in those
regions of the principle of the impartial opportunity
for all nations. Whether the result of this policy
would prove better or worse for the interest of any
one nation than the effect of an exclusive policy, did
not concern me. It did not and does not belong
to me to appeal to the commercial instinct of the
reader, or even to his sympathy with, or antipathy
to, either of the present belligerents. My only plea
is that for truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substance of the introductory chapter, as has
been said, and also a brief summary of the body
of the volume have been published in the <cite>Yale
Review</cite> for May and August of the present year.
I am greatly indebted to the editors of the <cite>Review</cite>
for allowing me to use the material in the
preparation of this work. I also wish to express
my sincere thanks to my friends who have encouraged
me in the publication of this volume.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE CONFLICT</h3>

<p class='c013'>The deeper significance of the present dramatic
struggle between Russia and Japan over territories
belonging to neither of the contestants cannot
perhaps be understood, until we examine some of
the issues at stake between them. The more fundamental
of these issues, however, as in many another
international crisis, seem to be oftener understood
than expressed, and hence understood only vaguely,
although it may fairly be said that they constitute
the very forces which have with irresistible certainty
brought the belligerents into collision. For
Japan, the issues appear to be only partly political,
but mainly economical; and perhaps no better clue
to the understanding, not only of the present situation,
but also, in general, of the activities at home
and abroad of the Japanese people, could be found
than in the study of these profound material
interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the most remarkable tendencies of Japan’s
economic life of recent years has been the
enormous increase of her population, along with an
immense growth of her trade and industries. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>number of her inhabitants increased from 27,200,000,
as estimated in 1828, to only 34,000,000 in
1875, but since that year it has risen so fast that it is
to-day 46,305,000<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a>—exclusive of the 3,082,404<a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
in Formosa and the Pescadores—and is increasing
now at the annual rate of nearly 600,000. At the
same time, the foreign trade of Japan has grown
from 49,742,831 <em>yen</em> in 1873 to 606,637,959 <em>yen</em>
in 1903. Up to the end of May, 1904, the total
amount showed 274,012,437 <em>yen</em>, as compared with
the 248,506,103 <em>yen</em> of the same period of 1903.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
The significance of these figures must be seen in the
light of the important fact that the bulk of the
increase in population and trade has been due
to the decisive change of the economic life of the
nation from an agricultural to an industrial stage.
The new population seems to increase far more
rapidly in the urban than in the rural districts, for
if we consider as urban the inhabitants of communities
containing each more than three thousand
people, the ratio of the urban population to the
rural may be estimated as 1 to 3. If only towns
of more than 10,000 inhabitants each are included
in the urban class, it is seen that their population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>increases annually 5 or 6 per cent., while the corresponding
rate with the rural communities never
rises above 3 per cent. and is usually much lower.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
This comparatively rapid growth of the cities also
indicates that the new population must be mainly
supported by commerce and manufacture.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1903, 84.6 per cent. of the total export trade
of Japan consisted of either wholly or partly
manufactured articles.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> On the other hand, agriculture
has progressed only slowly,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and is no
longer able either to support the increased population
or to produce enough raw articles for the
manufactures. The average annual crop of rice
may be put at 210 million bushels, and that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>barley, rye, and wheat, collectively called <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">mugi</span></i>, at
94.3 million bushels, while the average annual consumption
of these cereals may safely be estimated,
respectively, at 228.3 and 106.7 million bushels.
In years of poor crops, the importation of rice,
wheat, and flour amounts to large figures; as, for
instance, in 1903, they together were imported to
the value of about 67 million <em>yen</em>.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> Raw material
and food-stuffs, consisting of cotton, wool, rice,
flour and starch, beans and oil-cakes, the importation
of all of which was next to nothing twenty
years ago, were in 1903 supplied from abroad to
the value of 169,600,000 <em>yen</em>, or 53.5 per cent. of
the total imports of Japan.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Japan will not only
always have to rely upon foreign countries for the
supply of these articles, but also have to import
them in ever increasing quantities. Nor does agriculture
occupy in the national finances the position
it once did, for in 1875 the land tax, the incidence
of which fell, as it still falls, very largely on the
farmer, supplied 78 per cent. of the total revenue
of the state, while the percentage fell, in the estimated
budget for the fiscal year 1902–3, to 16,
the actual amount also decreasing during the interval
from 67.7 to 37 million <em>yen</em>, and the expenditures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the government, on the other hand,
increasing from 73.4 million in 1874, to the enormous
figure of 223.18 million <em>yen</em> in 1904–5.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>No one can say a cheerful word about agriculture
in Japan or the life of her farmer. Exclusive
of Formosa, the development of which seems to lie
in the direction of industry and trade rather than
agriculture, less than 13,000,000 acres are under
cultivation,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> or, about 13 per cent. of the extent of
the country, while the arable area of the land
cannot possibly be increased by more than 10,500,000
acres,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> so that the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</span></i> share of arable
land is less than one half of an acre,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> which is even
below the corresponding rate in England and less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>than one half of that in China. Japan’s agricultural
life can, however, be no more intensively improved
than extensively enlarged. The sedimentary
soil so well adapted to the rice cultivation and so
abundantly blessed with moisture<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> is too minutely
and carefully tilled, the climate conditions are too
cleverly made use of,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and, above all, the lots of
land are too diminutive,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> to make the importation
of new machinery and methods always profitable
or desirable.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> The day-laborers on the farm receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>wages ranging between nine and fifteen cents,
though the latter have risen more than 100 per
cent. during the last fifteen years.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> With this
meagre income, some of the laborers have to support
their aged parents, wives, and children. The
tenants, whose number bears the ratio of about two
to one<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> to that of the proprietors, live literally from
hand to mouth, and cannot always afford even the
necessary manure, and the proprietor’s profit hardly
rises above 5 per cent., while the capital he employs
pays an interest of 15 to 30 per cent.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and
his local and central taxes further reduce his income.
The farmer would in many cases be unable
to subsist, were it not possible for him, as it fortunately
is, to try his hand at silk-culture or some
other subsidiary occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Japan’s agriculture, then, can neither be much extended
nor be greatly improved, can neither satisfy
the old population nor support the new, and, above
all, can only produce smaller and smaller portion
of the necessary raw material for her growing industries.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Under these circumstances, it is becoming
more evident every year that the time is forever
past when the nation could rely solely upon agriculture
for subsistence. It is hardly necessary to
repeat the well-known law of population—which
is at the root of our subject—that every advance
in the economic life of a nation creates a situation
which is capable of supporting a larger population
than in the preceding stage. What agriculture
cannot support, industry and trade may. Japan’s
growing population may only be supported, as it
has already begun to be, by an increased importation
of raw material and food-stuffs and an
increased exportation of manufactures. Trade
statistics unmistakably show that such markets for
her manufactures and such supply regions of her
raw and food articles are found primarily in East
Asia, with which the commercial relations of Japan
have grown 543 per cent. since 1890, as compared
with the 161 per cent.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> increase of the American
and the 190 per cent. increase of the European
trade,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> until the East Asiatic trade amounted in
1903 to 295,940,000 <em>yen</em> in value, or 48.7 per
cent. of the entire foreign trade of Japan.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>following table gives a comparison of the importation
in the years 1882, 1902, and 1903, of what
may be considered as primarily East Asiatic products:<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c007'>From these eloquent facts, the conclusion would
seem tenable that, should the markets of East Asia
be closed, Japan’s national life would be paralyzed,
as her growing population would be largely deprived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>of its food and occupation. These markets, then,
must be left as open as the circumstances permit, if
Japan would exist as a growing nation. Observe
here the tremendous significance for Japan of the
principle of the “open door” as applied to East
Asia—the principle, in a more accurate language,
of the equal opportunity in East Asia for the economic
enterprise of all foreign nations.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this great problem Manchuria and Korea occupy,
perhaps, the most important position, for they
together receive a large portion of the cotton yarn
and cotton textiles exported from Japan, besides
several other manufactured goods and coal, and in
return supply Japan with much of the wheat and
rice, and practically all of the millet, beans, and oil-cakes,
imported into the country. Let us briefly
demonstrate these statements by figures. First, consider
the exportation of cotton yarns and textiles
from Japan to Manchuria and Korea. It is rather
difficult from the material on hand to estimate the
exact ratio which the import of these articles from
Japan into Korea and Manchuria bears to the total
import of the same articles from all nations. In the
case of Korea, we can make an approximate estimate,
as we possess both the export values in Japan and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>import values in Korea, but with regard to Manchuria,
we know only the quantities, but not the
values, of the cotton goods imported. By assuming,
however, that 40 per cent. of these goods imported
by the Chinese Empire from Japan go to North
China (of which Manchuria is here considered by
far the most important part), it may be said, roughly,
that in 1903 about 6 per cent. of the cotton yarn
exported from Japan went to Korea and perhaps 40
per cent. to North China. The average import of
this article during the past two years was probably
1,200,000 <em>yen</em> in Korea and 8,000,000 <em>yen</em> in North
China, making the total about 36 per cent. of the
export value in Japan. On the same basis of calculation,
the average importation of cotton textiles
from Japan during the past three years was 3,190,000
<em>yen</em> in Korea and 765,000 <em>yen</em> in North China,
or about 69.5 per cent. of the entire export of these
articles from Japan. These figures are only tentative,
but may serve to show that Manchuria receives
comparatively much yarn and Korea much textiles,
and that they together receive at least a large percentage
of those articles exported by Japan, where
their manufacture occupies an increasingly important
place in her economic life.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> As to the exportation
of agricultural products from Manchuria and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Korea, it is seen that wheat is only beginning to be
cultivated in Manchuria, while the rice cultivation
is there practically unknown except in a few places
near the Korean border, where during the campaign
of 1894–5 the Japanese troops introduced it. The
position which Korea occupies in the importation
of wheat into Japan will be seen from the following

<p class='c007'>A glance at these figures will show that the import
trade of wheat, like that of rice, is dependent
on many fluctuating conditions at home and abroad.
The poor crop in Japan caused an enormous importation
of wheat in 1903 to the value of 4,767,000
<em>yen</em>. From the above table, it is seen that Korea
supplied during the five years, respectively, 57.5,
80.7, 23.1, 19.1, and 98.8 per cent., in weight, of
the wheat imported into Japan. As regards rice, the

<p class='c007'>An explanation is necessary that, to all probability,
much of the oil-cakes from Russian Asia was reëxported
from Manchuria. In 1903, beans and oil-cakes
were imported to the value of, respectively,
7,993,000 and 10,739,000 <em>yen</em>. In considering all
these facts as a whole, attention is called to a point
of immense importance, that Manchuria and Korea
supply Japan with necessaries of life, and receive
in return, in the main, useful goods, instead of
wares of luxury. We shall have occasion further
to develop this point.</p>

<p class='c000'>while the grains exported from Korea go almost
entirely to Japan, different ports of Korea present
of course different characteristics in their trade with
Japan: as, for instance, at Chemulpo the Chinese
merchants still enjoy a considerable share in the
import trade; at Seul nearly all the export consists
of gold bullion, which is almost exclusively bought
by the branch of the First Bank of Japan; while
at Fusan and Mokpo the Japanese monopoly of
trade is almost complete. With these variations,
however, the Japanese merchants control the major
part of the trade of each port, and consequently of
the entire trade of Korea. They also carry a large
amount of foreign goods to Korea, as seen in the

<p class='c000'>at Niu-chwang, which was then the only important
port in Manchuria open to foreign trade under the
ordinary customs rules.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>In this connection, it should be remembered that
both the Korean and Manchurian trade are of recent
origin. Niu-chwang was opened as a treaty port in
1858, but its commercial importance may be said to
date from 1899. Korea’s foreign trade did not
begin till 1884, and it exceeded 10,000,000 <em>yen</em>
for the first time in 1895. The rapid growth of
the trade of these places has been largely due to the
increasing trade activity of Japan. In the case of
Niu-chwang, it is true the development of its import
trade has been as much owing to the energy
of the Americans as to that of the Japanese, but
its export business would be meagre, and would consequently
reduce the imports also, but for Japanese
activity. The recent increase in the production of
millet in Manchuria, for instance, may be said to be
entirely due to Japanese trade at Niu-chwang. Of
the three staple products of Western Manchuria, tall
millet is consumed by the natives, and beans are
partly consumed and partly exported, while millet
is cultivated purely for the purpose of exportation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It began to be exported to Korea in August, 1901,
and to Japan in 1902. Since the latter year, Japan’s
demand for millet has steadily increased, and
has caused a considerable rise in its price at Niu-chwang.
The cultivation of millet, therefore, is a
pure gain that has been created by the trade relations
of Manchuria with Japan.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Far more important
than millet as articles for exportation are beans
and bean-cakes. The entire trade conditions at Niu-chwang
may be said to depend upon the amount of
the sale of these articles. The more they are sold,
the greater is the importing capacity of the people
of Manchuria. The nation which buys beans and
bean-cakes in the largest quantities naturally commands
the greatest facility in pushing their imports
into Niu-chwang. The exportation of these goods
doubled during the ten years between 1889 and
1898, while the amount of the bean production in
Manchuria for 1900 was estimated at between
1,930,000 and 2,450,000 <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">koku</span></i>. Both the production
and the exportation must now be much greater.
The increase was due in the main to the growing
demand in Japan for beans and bean-cakes, as witness
the following ratios of exports to China and
Japan from Niu-chwang:—</p>

<p class='c007'>If we examine the causes of the growth of individual
open ports in Korea, nothing can be plainer
than that it has almost entirely resulted from the
increasing trade relations between Korea and Japan.
It is needless to mention Fusan, for its trade is
nearly synonymous with its Japanese trade. Kunsan
was opened on May 1, 1899, and its population was
only 300 till two years ago, but the great demand
by Japan for the rice coming through this port has
already tended to enlarge the number of its inhabitants
up to 2000 or more.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Similar remarks may
be made of Mokpo, Chinnampo, and other ports.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
Most conspicuous, however, is the case of Chemulpo.
In 1883, when it was opened as a treaty port, it
contained only a few fishers’ houses, but now it holds
a population of 15,000, and occupies a position in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Korea similar to that of Shanghai in China. Of the
inhabitants of the ports, 8000, or more than a half,
are Japanese. Streams of Koreans also have flowed
hither from inland towns, for there the officials
oppress people, while here they are so constantly
viewed by the foreigners that undue exactions are
impossible.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> We have already noted the important
fact that Korea and Manchuria on the one hand and
Japan on the other exchange, not wares of luxury,
but useful and necessary articles. We have now come
to another equally important fact, that the growth
of the Manchurian and Korean trade depends largely
upon the commercial activity of Japan. From these
considerations, it would seem safe to say that the
trade interests of the three countries are largely
<em>common</em>, for the more Korea and Manchuria export
to Japan, the greater will be their purchasing power
of Japanese goods, and, also, the larger the exportation
from Japan to Manchuria and Korea, the more
readily they will dispose of their products to her.
On the one hand, Korea and Manchuria encourage
the growth of Japan’s manufacture, and supply
her with food and manure; on the other hand, the
economic development and prosperity of Korea and
Manchuria must be largely determined by the increasing
demand for their products by Japan, and
the easy supply of their wants from Japan. The
future growth of the three nations, then, must in
a large measure depend upon the intimate progress,
of their trade interests, which, therefore, not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>are common, but should be increasingly common.
If the history of the past suggests the probable development
in the future, there is every reason to
believe that, with reformed systems of currency and
improved and extended cultivation of land and
means of transportation, the trade of Manchuria
and Korea will show a tremendous increase, and
then the community of interest between them and
Japan will be most profound.</p>

<p class='c007'>This theme of the community of interest may
further be elaborated. Korea and Manchuria may
with profit remain open, not only for the trade, but
also for the emigration and industrial enterprise, of
the Japanese people. Since 1902 no passports have
been required for travelers from Japan to Korea,
whither, in spite of the occasional obstacles placed
in their way by Korean officials, the emigrants have
proceeded, now for years, in increasing numbers,
until there resided in 1903 nearly thirty thousand
Japanese in the Peninsula.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> It takes only thirteen
hours on sea from Bakan in Japan to Fusan in
Korea, and the cost is even less than that of sailing
to the Japanese colony of Formosa, the former being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>fifteen <em>yen</em> and the latter twenty. It seems easier to
go from Bakan to Fusan than it is from Osaka to the
Hokkaidō within Japan proper.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The expense of
living in Korea is also as low as one third the corresponding
figure in Japan, a monthly income of ten or
thirteen <em>yen</em> being considered sufficient to support a
family of three persons in a rented house.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> It is not
strange, under these conditions, that the Japanese
migrate to Korea, not always singly, like the Chinese,
but often in families,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> so that their settlements
assume there a normal and permanent character
unseen even in Japan’s own island of Formosa. Nor
are all these colonists mere laborers like their
brethren in Manchuria and the Hawaiian Islands,
but many are independent men of business. They
also naturally manifest a stronger sense of kinship
and coöperation in Korea than the merchants and
capitalists do in Japan. In several Korean towns
these Japanese settlers have established their own
municipalities, with modern improvements, chambers
of commerce, police, and public schools, all of
which compare favorably with those of the larger
cities in Japan, and the advantages of which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>enjoyed by native Koreans and resident Chinese.
It is said that in some places the influx of the Japanese
and their investments have caused a rise in
the price of land and house rent.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> In Fusan, the
port nearest to Japan, the 10,000 Japanese who live
there own large tracts of land and occupy the main
sections of the city. Here and everywhere else the
Japanese colonists seem to hold a position similar to
that of the foreigners living in the so-called settlements
in the larger treaty ports of China. Tourists
are wont to contrast the clean and well-ordered
streets and the general energetic appearance of the
Japanese quarters in Korean cities with the comparatively
filthy and slothful Korean quarters. The
branches of the First Bank of Japan have been
issuing recently one-, five-, and ten-<em>yen</em> bank-notes,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
which have been of immense value to the foreign
trade in Korea, the native currency of which is in a
deplorable condition.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> The coasting and river navigation,
so far as it concerns foreign trade, is largely
controlled by the Japanese, who, besides, own the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>only railway line in operation in Korea, twenty-six
miles long, running between the capital, Seul, and
its port Chemulpo.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> They are also building,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a> under
the management of substantially the same company,
another and longer line—two hundred and eighty-seven
miles—between Seul and the port of Fusan,
which passes through the richer and economically by
far the more important half of the Peninsula.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>not impossible to suppose that the Japanese people
will succeed in their efforts to secure the right of
extending this line beyond Seul up to Wiju on the
northern border,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and thence ultimately connecting
it with the Eastern Chinese and the Peking-Shanghaikwan-Sinminting
Railways, so as to render the
connection by rail between Fusan and China and
Europe complete.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> The Mitsui Produce Company,
another Japanese concern, monopolized the export
of Korean ginseng, and, in 1903, despite the competition
of the Russian Baron Gunzburg,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in extending the term of the monopoly for five years.
Twenty to forty thousand Japanese fishermen along
the Korean coast report an annual catch amounting
sometimes to large figures.</p>

<p class='c007'>No part of Korea’s economic life, however, would
seem to be of greater importance to her own future,
or to depend more closely upon the enterprise
of the Japanese settlers, than her agriculture. If
it is remembered that nearly all her exports consist
of agricultural products, and also that they largely
supply the needs of Japan, we can readily comprehend
the great community of interest felt by both
countries in the agriculture of the Peninsula. It is
remarkable to note, to take a single instance, that the
production of cereals and beans (respectively about
eight and four million <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">koku</span></i>) in Korea has grown
to its present dimensions largely owing to the stimulus
given to it by the increased demand for these
articles in Japan.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> We shall presently note also that,
owing to the peculiar circumstances prevailing in
Korea, her purchasing power and general commercial
activity are so completely ruled by the conditions
of her weather and crops as is seldom the
case with other agricultural nations. The Koreans
are comparatively happy in good years, while in bad
years they are reduced to great miseries and bandits
infest all parts of the country. Upon the state
of her agriculture, then, must depend the trade conditions
of Korea, as well as most of her material
strength and much of that of Japan. From this it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>is plain that the profound community of interest of
the two nations calls for both the extension and the
improvement of the agriculture of Korea. It is estimated
that the extent of her land under cultivation
is hardly more than 3,185,000 acres, or about
6.3 per cent. of the 82,000 square miles known as
the total area of the country,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a> and that there exist
at least 3,500,000 more acres of arable land, which
would be fully capable of sustaining five or six
millions of new population, and of increasing the
annual crops of the land by not less than 150,000,000
<em>yen</em>.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Unfortunately, however, the Koreans
lack energy to cultivate those three and a half million
acres of waste land. For it is well known that
the irregular but exhaustive exactions of the Korean
officials have bred a conviction in the mind of the
peasant that it is unwise to bestir himself and earn
surplus wealth only to be fleeced by the officials.
His idleness has now for centuries been forced,
until it has become an agreeable habit. It is in this
state of things that is has often been suggested that
the cultivation of the waste lands may most naturally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>be begun by the superior energy of the Japanese settlers.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
Not less important than the cultivation of new
land is the improvement of old land in Korea, where
the art of husbandry is far less advanced than in
either China or Japan. Lots are marked out carelessly,
improvements are crude, and the manure
most universally used is dried grass. The great
rivers with all their numerous ramifications are
hardly utilized for the purpose of irrigation, and the
forests have been mercilessly denuded for fuel and
in order to forestall the requisition of the government,—which
formerly used to order without compensation
the cutting and transporting of trees by
their owners,—so that a slight drought or excess
of rain works frightful disasters upon agriculture.
Another serious effect of the absence of a good system
of irrigation is the comparative want of rice
land, which always requires a most careful use of
water.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> These conditions are all the more to be regretted,
when it is seen that the soil is generally
fair and the climate favorable. The cultivation of
rice is said to have been first taught by the Japanese
invaders toward the end of the sixteenth century,
and yet, with all their primitive method, the Koreans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>are already exporting rice to the value of four
million <em>yen</em> or more. Sericulture is still in its infancy,
while tea, cotton, hemp, sugar, and various
fruits are all declared to be tolerably well suited to
the soil. The Japanese farmer finds here, particularly
in the south, a climate and general surroundings
very similar to his own, and otherwise eminently
agreeable to his habits, and, along with the application
of his superior methods of cultivation, irrigation,
and forestry, the common interests of his
country and Korea are bound to develop with great
rapidity. The progress of agriculture would also
gradually lead the Koreans into the beginnings of
an industrial life, while the expanding systems of
railways and banking would be at once cause and
effect of the industrial growth of the nation. Another
inevitable result would be the development of
the economic sense and the saving capacity of the
Korean, the latter of which has had little opportunity
to grow, not so much because of his small
wage and high rent and interest, as because of the
onerous, irregular local dues and the systematic exactions
in various forms by the official.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> An advanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>economic life, itself necessitating a reform of the
official organization, would at least make it possible
for the peasant to work, earn, and save. Simultaneously
and in increasing degree would his wants, as
well as his purchasing power, increase. Around the
progress of Korea’s agriculture, then, must be built
all other measures of her growth and power, as,
for instance, transportation, industries, trade and
commerce, finance, political reform, and military
strength. In no other way can we conceive of
the possibility of her effective independence, the
cause of which has cost Japan, and is now costing
her, so dearly. In no other light can we interpret
the Korean sovereignty under the assistance of
Japan.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to Manchuria, where the chances for
development are far vaster, the Japanese people do
not possess there as large vested interests, but entertain
as great expectations for its future settlement
and industry as in Korea. It was estimated
before the present war that there resided more than
ten thousand Japanese in Manchuria, who were
either under the employment of Russian authorities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>in public works along the railway, or engaged in
such small occupations as laundry work, carpentry,
restaurant-keeping, photographing, and hair-dressing,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
while many of the Japanese women, whose
numbers in many a town preponderated over those
of men, had been allured by unscrupulous parties,
who consigned them to disreputable occupations.
Merchants and business men of greater capital and
resources would be, as they often have been, attracted
to Manchuria, were it not for the exclusive,
and in the hands of some of their officials, arbitrary,
measures of the Russians.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> Under normal conditions
of peace and “open door,” the immensely
greater resources of Manchuria and the much
greater productiveness of its people<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> would seem
to promise even a more important economic future
than in Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>In summing up our preceding discussion, it may
be stated that the natural growth or unnatural
decay of the Japanese nation will greatly depend—ever
more greatly than it now does—upon whether
Manchuria and Korea remain open or are closed to
its trade, colonization, and economic enterprise; and
that, in her imperative desire for the open door,
Japan’s wish largely coincides with that of the
European and American countries, except Russia,
whose over-production calls for an open market in
the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far we have discussed only Japan’s side of
the economic problem in Manchuria and Korea.
Passing to Russia’s side, it is seen that her vested
interests in Manchuria are as enormous as her commercial
success there has been small. The building
of the Eastern Chinese Railway has cost the incredible
sum of 270,000,000 rubles, making the average
cost per verst more than 113,000 rubles,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> or over
$87,000 per mile, besides 70,000,000 rubles lost
and expended during the Boxer outrages and Manchuria
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>campaign of 1900,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> to say nothing of the
normal annual cost of guarding the railway by
soldiers, estimated at 24,000,000 rubles.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> The investments
in permanent properties alone, besides
the railway, are moderately valued at 500,000,000
rubles.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> In return for these heavy outlays, the trade
relations between Russia and Manchuria have been
most disappointing. Though it is not possible to obtain
the exact figures of the actual trade between
Manchuria and European Russia, we can establish
approximate estimates in the following manner.
According to official returns, exports from Russia to
her Far Eastern Possessions were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The decline must be largely due to the decreased
demand for military and railway supplies, for it is
seen that the falling-off has been most conspicuous
in iron and steel wares and machinery.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> At the
same time there was little or no import trade from
the Russian possessions in the East into Russia,
for the native products sent out from the former
never passed beyond Eastern Siberia. It would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>interesting if we could find out how much of these
Russian exports went to Manchuria. The figures

<p class='c000'>might be considered an approximate amount of
the export trade from Russia to Manchuria (and
Mongolia, which imports very little from Russia),
for, of the Pacific ports, no other port but Vladivostok
reëxports Russian goods into Manchuria,
which reëxportation seems to be slight enough to
be ignored. The approximate correctness of the
figures is further seen from the fact that of the
total 8,193,000 rubles of the Manchurian trade at
Blagovestchensk, Habarofsk, and the South Ussuri
region—the three main points of transit trade
with Manchuria—only one half showed exports to
Manchuria, and again, of this one half, only a
portion consisted of reëxported Russian goods. The
South Ussuri district, for instance, sent only 130,800
and 206,000 rubles’ worth of Russian and
foreign goods to Manchuria, out of the total export
trade of 799,500 and 2,221,300 rubles, respectively,
in 1898 and 1899.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> On the other hand, before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>opening of the Manchurian Railway (which took
place in February, 1903), the <em>direct</em> trade between
Russia and the interior of Manchuria must have
been so slight as not to materially affect the sum-total
of the Russian-Manchurian trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>This remarkably unfavorable trade between Manchuria
and Russia was probably due to a decreased
demand for military supplies since 1900 (for Russia
has little to export from Manchuria, and Chinese teas
have largely gone through Kiakhta or by the Amur,
rather than by the Manchurian Railway), and also
to the difficulty of further reducing the freight
rates on the railway,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a> and of competing successfully
with the American and Japanese traders in certain
articles for importation.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> In spite of all the effort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>made by the late Finance Minister, M. Witte, Russia
is not yet primarily a manufacturing country,
her exportation of manufactured goods forming in
fact only 2.5 per cent. of her entire export trade,
and at best remaining stationary during the three
years 1900–2, as will be seen below:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Russia’s commercial failure in Manchuria in the
past would, however, in no way justify the inference
that the future will be as disappointing. All
competent observers seem to agree that the undeveloped
resources of the 364,000 square miles of
Manchuria are enormous.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> Its unknown mineral
wealth, its thousands of square miles of land now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>under the bean and millet cultivation, but beginning
to yield to the wheat culture and producing
wheat at a market price of not more than forty
cents per bushel, and its extensive lumber districts,
as well as its millions of cheap and most reliable
Chinese laborers,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> would before long enable the
Russians successfully to convert Manchuria into
one of the richest parts of China and one of the
richest countries in the world. A success of such
magnitude must, however, largely depend upon a
systematically protective and exclusive policy on
the part of Russia, or, in other words, upon the
completeness with which Russia transfers the bulk
of the Manchurian trade from the treaty port of
Niu-chwang, and, so far as the Russian import
from China is concerned, even from the once important
Russian port of Vladivostok, to the commercial
terminus of the Manchurian Railway—Dalny.
Particularly in order to capture the import
trade into Manchuria of cotton goods and kerosene
oil, in the face of the great advantages enjoyed by
American and Japanese competitors, Russia must
at all costs make Dalny overshadow Niu-chwang,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>so as to bring the trade under her complete control.
Nothing but a highly artificial system could
accomplish such wonders, for, under normal conditions,
teas for Russia would go by the less costly
routes through Kiakhta, or up the Amur, or by
sea to Odessa; the native products of Manchuria
for exportation to Japan would be sent to Niu-chwang
by the nearest, cheapest, and most natural
channel, the Liao River, and, when the latter freezes
between the end of November and March, by the
Shan-hai-kwan Railway; and, finally, the smaller
cost of production and lower rates of freight of the
American and Japanese cotton fabrics would completely
outdistance the Russian. Let us observe
with what artificial measures the Russians have been
meeting this situation. With a view to diverting
the tea trade from Vladivostok to Dalny, Russia
imposed an import duty of 3 rubles per pood from
August, 1902, and increased it in May, 1903, to
25.50 rubles,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> which with other measures dealt a
crushing blow to the prosperity of Vladivostok.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
This must at least have stifled the transportation
of tea up the Amur, without, perhaps, affecting
the inroad of teas through the old Kiakhta and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sea.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> As regards the export trade at Niu-chwang,
the Russians took advantage of the important fact
that the Shan-hai-kwan Railway did not penetrate
sufficiently north to reach some producing centres
of Western Manchuria, while the waters of the Liao
were navigable only 200 miles from the mouth, and
were, together with the harbor itself, ice-bound from
November till March. Dalny was nearly ice-free,
and the Manchurian Railway was available through
all seasons. The only competitors of the railroad
would seem to be the small bean-carrying junks
plying down the Liao, which were both owned and
loaded by the same Chinese merchants. This competition
the Russians met by greatly reduced freight
rates of the railway, which made it possible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>every 100 poods of Manchurian grain and beans
to be carried 600 miles between Harbin and Dalny
for about fifty-seven cents gold, or $10 per ton.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
From Dalny, heavily subsidized Russian boats transported
Manchurian exports to Japan at a freight rate
which, in conjunction with railway rates, amounted
to the saving by the shipper of 4.50 <em>yen</em> per ton, as
compared with the railway-rates <em>plus</em> the freight-rates
of non-Russian vessels.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> When the flour industry
of the Russian towns in Manchuria is developed,
Russian steamers may be seen carrying flour
from Dalny, not only to Japan, but to Chinese and
Eastern Siberian ports. As for the import trade of
Manchuria, the Russians, who have ousted American
importers of kerosene oil at Vladivostok, seem to
be now by energetic methods slowly driving away
the same rivals from Chemulpo and from Dalny.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Vastly more important as articles for importation
than kerosene oil are cotton yarn and textiles, which
are annually supplied from abroad to the value of
over 12,000,000 <em>taels</em>. By far the greater part of
sheetings, drills, and jeans comes from America.
The Russians were not unable to produce cotton
fabrics almost as good as the American goods, but
the trans-Siberian freight was twice as expensive
as the Pacific transportation, and could not be expected
to be further reduced without great difficulty.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
It was not impossible to suppose that the
Russian Government might ultimately apply to
Manchuria the system of granting a premium and
an additional drawback on textiles made from imported
cotton, which had been in successful operation
in Persia. There was no question but that,
together with the development of Manchuria under
Russian control, foreigners would lose most of their
import trade in lumber, butter, and flour, and here
again the Russian success must depend on the
exclusiveness of their policy.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> Mr. H. B. Miller,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the United States Consul at Niu-chwang, seems
to have made a delicate reference to this point
when he said, in his report dated December 5,
1903: “The United States trade in Manchuria
with the Chinese amounted to several millions of
dollars per year, and was almost entirely imports.
It had grown very fast, and would have had an
extended and most substantial increase without the
Russian development, for the country was being
improved and extensively developed with a continual
immigration from other provinces in China,
before the railway construction began.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Much has
been said regarding the oft-reiterated wish of Russia
to keep Dalny as a free port, but it is well known
that it has recently been placed under a protective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>tariff.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> We are not in possession of the details of
this tariff, but its general significance can hardly be
mistaken when we see how the Russians have been
reducing freight rates to the utmost, subsidizing
their own steamers, and pooling together their great
banking and railway facilities, all for the purpose,
on the one hand, of developing Russian industries
in Manchuria, and on the other, of monopolizing
the bulk of its trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only in trade, but in colonization also, the
Russians have been building up new cities and developing
old ones under their exclusive policy with
an unheard-of rapidity. Dalny is a good example
of the former class. Still more conspicuous is the
city of Harbin, the so-called Moscow of Asia, the
geographical and commercial centre and headquarters
of the railway work in Manchuria, which
is said to have consisted of a single Chinese house
in 1898,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> but now contains 50,000 people.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Well
might Count Cassini, as he did, refer, not only to
the colonization, but to the general civilizing influence
of the Russians in Manchuria in the following
language:<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> “Through the pacific channels
of diplomacy my government acquired privileges
which, accepted in good faith, have been exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in a spirit of true modern progressiveness,
until now the flower of enlightened civilization
blooms throughout a land that a few years ago
was a wild, and in many parts a desolate, seemingly
unproductive waste. Before the signing of
the treaty which I had the honor to negotiate in
behalf of my Sovereign, giving to Russia railroad
and other concessions in Manchuria, no white
man could have ventured into that province without
danger to his life.... Upon the basis of
the rights to commercial exploitation thus peaceably
obtained, Russia built a railway into and
through Manchuria. She built bridges, roads, and
canals. She has built cities whose rapid construction
and wonderful strides in population and industry
have no parallel, certainly in Europe and
Asia, perhaps even in America. Harbin and Dalny
are monuments to Russian progressiveness and civilization.
These great undertakings, wonderful even
in a day of marvelous human accomplishment,
have cost Russia more than 300,000,000 dollars.”
Without stopping either to dispute the historical
accuracy of Count Cassini’s statement or to deny
the wonderful work the Russians have accomplished
in Manchurian cities, it seems pertinent to call our
attention to the exclusive side of the Russian enterprise
in this vast territory. Harbin is one of
the so-called “depots,” over eighty in number,
which are found along the whole length of the
Manchurian Railway, each one of which extends
over several square miles, within which none but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>the Russians and Chinese have the right of permanent
settlement.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Russia would not consent to
the opening of Harbin (and, presumably, all other
cities within the “depots” of the Manchurian Railway)
to foreign trade. Even outside of these cities,
the Russian Government appeared to be opposed
to the opening of new ports, and when it was no
longer politic to continue the opposition, Russia
informed other Powers in 1903 that she had no
intention of objecting to the opening of new treaty
ports “without foreign settlements” in Manchuria.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The meaning of all these protective and exclusive
measures becomes plain, when it is seen that
the complete control of the economic resources of
Manchuria would give Russia, not only sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>means to support Eastern Siberia, but also a great
command over the trade of China and Japan. The
latter country Russia might be able to reduce to dire
distress, when necessary, by closing the supplies
coming from Manchuria, upon which Japan will have
to depend every year more closely than before.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> The
success of these great designs on the part of Russia
would depend upon how completely protective and
exclusive her Manchurian policy can be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming from Manchuria to Korea, we find the
economic position of the Russians in a totally different
situation, for either their vested or even their
potential interests in the Peninsula were slight, excepting,
perhaps, their already acquired timber concessions<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
on the northern frontier and the Kaiserling
whale fishery on the northeastern coast.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>been pointed out, however, that the fact that Dalny
was not altogether ice-free made Russia covet Chemulpo
or some other trade port on the western coast
of Korea.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> However that may be, it is safe to say
that Russia’s interests in Korea are slightly economic,
but almost wholly strategic and political.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us sum up our discussion at this point, and
compare the economic interests of Russia and Japan
in Manchuria and Korea. In Manchuria, both
Powers seek trade and colonization, with the important
difference that Japan’s interests are actually
great and potentially greater, while those of Russia
are both actually and potentially preponderant. A
difference of greater moment lies, however, in the
fact that, so far as her trade and industry are concerned,
Japan’s interests call for an equal opportunity
there for all industrial nations, while Russia’s
interests may be maintained and developed only
by a highly exclusive policy. In Korea, its opening
for the trade, settlement, and enterprise of
the Japanese is not only the most natural method
of strengthening Korea herself, but also a primary
condition for the life and growth of Japan. Russia’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>economic interests there, on the other hand, may be
measured by the number of her resident subjects and
the extent of their enterprise, which are, outside of
Yong-am-po, next to nothing. Her interests, being,
as we shall soon see, mainly strategic and political,
demand here also a policy directly opposed to the
open door. If we now consider Manchuria and
Korea together, it may be said that Russia’s economic
interests are, even in Manchuria, rather for
her glory as a great, expanding empire than for any
imperative need of trade and emigration in that
particular part of her Asiatic dominion, while similar
interests of Japan, primarily in Korea and secondarily
in Manchuria, are vital, as they are essential
for her own life and development as a nation. The
case for Russia can, perhaps, never be understood
until her <em>political</em> issues are examined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Politically, also, the interests of the two Powers
are found to be directly opposed to one another.
It has been rightly said that Manchuria is the keynote
of the Eastern policy of Russia. Besides its
immense wealth still unexploited, Manchuria possesses
the great Port Arthur, which is the only
nearly ice-free naval outlet for Russia in her vast
dominion in Asia, while the 1500 miles of the
Manchurian Railway, together with the Great Siberian
Railway, connect this important naval station
with the army bases in Siberia and European Russia,
so that Manchuria alone would seem to be politically
more valuable for Russia than the rest of her
Asiatic territories. Without Manchuria, Russia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>would be left inclosed in the ice-bound Siberia,
with no naval or commercial outlet during nearly
five months of each year. With Manchuria, Russia’s
traditional policy, which has repeatedly failed since
Peter the Great on the Baltic Sea and other European
waters, as also on the Persian Gulf,—the
policy of becoming the dominant naval power of
the world,—would at last begin to be realized. The
very importance of Manchuria for Russia, however,
constitutes a serious menace to Japan and to the
general peace of the Far East. In the first place,
the Russian control of Port Arthur gives her a large
measure of control over the water approaches to
Peking, while the Mongolian Railway now reported
to be in contemplation would bring Russian land
forces directly upon the capital of the Chinese Empire.
The very integrity of China is threatened,
and a more serious disturbance of the peace of the
world could hardly be imagined than the general
partition and internal outbreaks in China which
would follow the fall of Peking under the pressure
of Russia from Manchuria and Mongolia. Not less
grave is the fact that Manchuria is geographically
and historically connected with the Peninsula of
Korea,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a> which makes Russia’s occupation of Korea
a necessary adjunct of her possession of Manchuria.
Geographically considered, there exists no abrupt
change from the eastern part of Manchuria to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>northern half of Korea,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a> which fact goes far to explain
the Russian solicitude to obtain railway and
other concessions between the frontier and Seul.
Even more serious conditions exist on the southern
coast of Korea, which contains the magnificent harbor
of Masampo, which constitutes the Gibraltar
between the Russian fleets at the ice-bound and remote
Vladivostok and the incommodious and not
altogether ice-free Port Arthur, with no effective
means of connecting them. By controlling this
coast, Russia would not merely possess a truly ice-free,
and the best naval port to be found in East
Asia,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> but also at last feel secure in Manchuria and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>complete her Far Eastern design of absorbing Korea
and China and pressing down toward India. If, on
the contrary, another Power should control Masampo,
it would be able to watch the movement of the
Russian fleets in their attempts to unite with one another,
and also seriously impede the greatest hopes
of Russia’s Eastern expansion. From Japan’s standpoint,
the Russian occupation of this section of
Korea would not only possibly close Korea against
her trade and enterprise, but also threaten her own
integrity. Only fifty miles away lie the Japanese
islands of Tsushima, which Russia has always coveted,
and which would have been hers had it not
been for the shrewd diplomacy of the late Count
Katsu.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> From Tsushima the mainland of Japan is
visible on the eastern horizon, so that the presence
of Russia at Masampo would arouse in the heart of
Japan the most profound feeling of unrest. Russia
must have Masampo, and Japan must not let her
have it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In concluding our discussion of the vital issues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>both economical and political, which are at stake,
it would seem that Manchuria is for Japan a great
market as well as an increasingly important supply
region of raw and food products and a field for
emigration, while for Russia it is the keynote of her
Eastern policy, and economically the most promising
of all her Asiatic possessions. On the other hand,
Korea is essential for Russia for the completion of
her Manchurian policy,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and for strengthening
enormously her general position in the East. For
Japan, Korea is nothing short of one half of her
vitality. By the opening or closing, strength or
weakness, independence or fall, of Korea, would
Japan’s fate as a nation be decided. On the contrary,
Russia, with Manchuria and ultimately Korea
in her hands, would be able, on the one hand, to
build up under her exclusive policy a naval and
commercial influence strong enough to enable her
to dominate the East, and, on the other, to cripple
forever Japan’s ambition as a nation, slowly drive
her to starvation and decay, and even politically
annex her. From Japan’s point of view, Korea and
China must be left open freely to the economic enterprise
of herself and others alike, and, in order
to effect that end, they must remain independent
and become stronger by their internal development
and reform.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a> Russia’s interests are intelligible, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>are Japan’s, but unfortunately their desires are antagonistic
to each other, so that a conflict between
an open and an exclusive policy is rendered inevitable.
The series of events during the past decades,
particularly since 1895, which we shall narrate in
this volume, has only served to bring this conflict
into a sharp clash in arms.</p>

<hr class='c030' />

<p class='c007'>In closing, it may not be entirely out of place to
attempt a speculation upon the significance of the
conflict, not to the belligerents, but to the world
at large. From the latter’s point of view, the contest
may fairly be regarded as a dramatic struggle
between two civilizations, old and new, Russia representing
the old civilization and Japan the new.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Two dominant features, among others, seem to
characterize the opposition of the contending nations:
namely, first, that Russia’s economics are
essentially agricultural, while those of Japan are
largely and increasingly industrial; and, secondly,
that Japan’s strength lies more on sea than on land,
while Russia represents an enormous contiguous
expansion on land. It is evident that the wealth of
a nation and its earning capacity cannot grow fast
under a trade system under which it imports many
and exports few manufactures.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a> The commercial
prosperity of Russia depended formerly upon its
nearness, first to the trade route with the Levant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and then to the free cities of Germany, but with
the fall of Constantinople and the decline of the
Hansa towns the business activity of Southern and
Baltic Russia has in turn passed away. Then, from
the time of Ivan the Terrible, she unified her European
territory, and expanded eastward on land,
until she had embraced within her dominion much
of Central and all of Northern Asia. For such an
expansion Russia seems to have been particularly
fitted, for her primitive economic organization suffers
little from external disturbances, while the autocratic
form of her government enables her to
maintain and execute her traditional policy of expansion.
But the real importance of her expansion
appears to be more territorial than commercial, for
the days of the land trade with the Orient are numbered.
Even the great Siberian Railway would not
successfully divert the Eastern trade landward.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> If
Russia would be prosperous she must control the
Eastern sea by occupying northeast China and
Korea. Here she comes in conflict with Japan, the
champion in the East of the rising civilization.
The economic centre of the world has been fast
passing to America, where cotton, wheat, coal, and
iron abound, the people excel in energy and intelligence,
and the government is servant to the welfare
and progress of the people. Japan has joined the
circle of this civilization, ever since the influence
of the youthful nation of America was extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to her through Commodore Perry<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> and Townsend
Harris, and the spirit of national progress through
industry and education was eagerly adopted by her.
To-day, Japan stands within the range of the interests
of the British and American sea-power over
the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, while Russia,
on the other hand, represents a vast expansion
on land.</p>

<p class='c007'>The historical bearing of the effects of the old
civilization to the world may, perhaps, be best characterized
by the one word—<em>unnatural</em>. Observe,
first, the effect of the policy of land aggression on
the internal affairs of Russia. The policy is costly.
Hence the great incongruity between the economics
of the people, which are agricultural, and the finance
of her government, which would be too expensive
even for the most highly advanced industrial nation.
Hence, also, it is, perhaps, that the richer and more
powerful her government becomes, the poorer and
more discontented her people seem to grow. Her
administration must naturally be maintained by the
suspicion of her people and the suppression of their
freedom,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and the suspicion and suppression must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>become more exhaustive as the disparity widens
between rulers and ruled.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> Under these circumstances,
a constitutional régime would not be possible,
for a free expression of the popular will
would be hardly compatible with a form of government
which seeks to strengthen the state at the
expense of the nation. Again, consider the unnatural
situation of an agricultural nation competing
in the world’s market with industrial, trading nations
which command a higher and more effective economic
organization. If Russia would sell her goods,
her markets abroad must be created and maintained

for the sake of artificially promoting the belated
manufactures in Russia.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> From this unnatural state
of things would seem to follow the Russian policy
of territorial occupation and commercial exclusion
in the East, and also her free use of the old-time
intrigue in diplomacy; for it is Russia’s fortune
that she would not be able to compete freely with
the new, growing civilization, whose open arts she
cannot employ to her advantage, but to whose advanced
standard of international morals she must
appear to conform. Her position forbids her to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>have recourse to an open policy and fair play, and
yet she cannot afford to overtly uphold the opposite
principles.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> On the other hand, the new civilization,
represented in the present contest by Japan,
relies more largely upon the energy and resources
of the individual person, whose rights it respects,
and upon an upright treatment by the nations of
one another.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the goal of the warfare of these two
civilizations? It is, it may be said, the immensely
rich and yet undeveloped North China, of which
Manchuria is a part, and to which Korea is an appendix.
Over this territory, the interests of Russia
and Japan have come to a clear and sharp clash,
those of the former demanding the subjection and
closure of this great portion of the earth’s surface,
and those of the latter imperatively calling for its
independence and progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whoever wins, the issues are momentous. If
Russia should win, not only Korea and Manchuria,
but also Mongolia would be either annexed by Russia
or placed under her protection, and Japan’s progress
would be checked and her life would begin to
fail. Russia would assume a commanding position
over all the Powers in the East, while the trading
nations of the world would be either largely or completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>excluded from an important economic section
of Asia. The Siberian railway system might at
last be made to pay, and Russia’s exclusive policy
would enable her and her ally France to divide
the profit of the Eastern trade with the more
active industrial nations. The old civilization would
enjoy an artificial revival, under the influence of
which China and Korea would be exploited by
the victors and, for the most part,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a> closed against
reformatory influences from abroad. All these momentous
results would be in the interest of an exclusive
policy incorporating principles which are
generally regarded as inimical to freedom and progress.
If, on the contrary, Japan should win, the
doubtful importance of the Siberian Railroad as a
carrier of the Eastern trade would in the mean time
be further overshadowed by the Panama Canal, and
it would be compelled to perform its perhaps proper
function of developing the vast resources of Siberia
and Manchuria. The Oriental commerce would be
equally free and open to all; the Empires of China
and Korea would not only remain independent,
but, under the influence of the new civilization, their
enormous resources would be developed and their
national institutions reformed, the immense advantages
of which would be enjoyed by all the nations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which are interested in the East. There would naturally
result a lasting peace in the East and the
general uplifting of one third of the human race.
Japan’s growth and progress after the war would
be even more remarkable than in the past. In short,
East Asia would be forcibly brought under the influence
of the new civilization, the effect of which would
not be without a profound reaction upon Russia
herself. Humanity at large, including the Russians,
would thereby be the gainer. The difference in the
effects of the outcome of the war, according to who
is the victor, would be tremendous. Which will
win, the old civilization or the new? The world at
this moment stands at the parting of the ways.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE<br /> ON THE SIBERIAN RAILWAY<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a></h3>

<p class='c013'>According to an estimate made by a Russian expert of
the carrying capacity of the great Siberian railway system,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
the Siberian section alone will carry at least 190
million poods, and the Manchurian section from 100 to
150 million poods, making a total of 300 to 350 million
poods, approximately. It is contended, however, that,
while the present conditions of the inhabitants of Siberia
and Manchuria make it possible for the railway to carry
only raw and crudely manufactured goods, these are the
very articles whose cost would easily be raised by the
long distance over which they have to be carried by rail.
In Europe, it never pays to carry these articles for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>longer distance than 2000 miles. Nor would it in Siberia,
unless abnormal reductions are made in freight rates, or
unless commerce and manufacture are artificially fostered
in Siberia and Manchuria. It is supposed, therefore, that
it would always be unprofitable to carry bulky, cheap
goods between Europe and the East on the Siberian Railway.
China’s exports to Russia consist of such costly
goods as teas and silks, which may be profitably transported
by rail, but thus far even teas have only begun to
be so transported under more or less artificial measures
in favor of the railway traffic at the expense of the routes
through Kiakhta, up the Amur, and by sea to Odessa.
As to Russian imports into China, cotton and woolen
goods and metals would never be carried by rail under
normal circumstances.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> The benefit of the eight thousand
versts of the railway from Moscow to Dalny may
be safely said to be as slight to the carrying trade as it is
great to the travelers and postal service between Europe
and the East.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statistics for 1899 and 1900 show that the bulk of
the Russian trade with China was carried on land, but
that the land trade was decreasing and sea trade increasing.
See the following table (unit 1000 rubles):<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be noted, however, that the period covered
by the table is not only too short, but also precedes the
opening of the Manchurian Railroad to trade, which took
place only in 1903. Nor should it be overlooked that the
figures indicate the China trade of <em>Russia</em> alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Regarding the <em>European</em> trade with China in general,
M. Sorokin, Assistant Director of Customs at Niu-chwang,
is reported to have remarked that the freight per pood
from Europe to the East was five rubles on land and 1.50
on sea.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Certain articles, such as glassware, tobacco, and
the like, seem to be carried from Russia to China at two
rubles by rail and one ruble by ships.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> The sea route consumes
nearly two months, but, for bulky merchandise,
it would be impossible for the railway to compete with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting, in this connection, to remember that,
from <em>America</em>, the freight between San Francisco and the
Eastern ports has been reduced repeatedly during the
last year, owing to the competition among the shipping
companies, so that the charge for flour does not seem to
be more than one mill per ton-mile, or forty cents a
hundred pounds for 8000 miles.</p>

<p class='c007'>During 1901, according to the latest statistics available,
the deficit of the Ussuri branch of the Siberian Railway
is said to have amounted to $435,162, and that of the
entire railway to $11,330,000.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c030' />

<p class='c007'>In this connection, it is interesting to note that this
view is further confirmed by no less authority than
Count Cassini, the present Russian Minister at Washington,
who, in his statement given on April 9, and published
in the <cite>North American Review</cite> for May, 1904, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“... Consider Russia’s position commercially toward
Manchuria with that of the United States. In this country
[the United States] are made not only the very materials
that would find a sale among the people of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>province, but with American goods shipped by an all-water
route, the cost of transportation would be much
lower than the cost of carrying on the all-land routes to
which Russia would be confined. Should Russia ship
by water to Manchuria from Odessa, the distance would
still be too great to make competition with the United
States successful. From Moscow to Port Arthur the distance
by rail is 5000 miles. It is therefore easy to realize
the privileged position of the United States in competing
over an all-water route from the Pacific coast, with
Russia over an all-rail route.”<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>RETROCESSION OF THE LIAO-TUNG PENINSULA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The way in which the momentous <em>issues</em> already discussed
in the introductory chapter have been at work
and have steadily culminated in the present conflict
is with unusual clearness and in the most instructive
manner illustrated by the <em>historic events</em> which led
up to the outbreak of the war. The study of these
events also appears essential for an intelligent understanding
of the situation, for, in this crisis, as in
many another in history, the contestants do not seem
to be always conscious of even the more important
issues at stake, while the events, in their main outlines,
are patent to every one. The former may be
found only by an analysis of facts, some of which
are obscure, but the latter are narrated dramatically,
from time to time as they occur or are published, in
the press and in the diplomatic correspondence, so
that it is little wonder that the events are often
taken for the causes, even the significance, of the
supreme fact to which they seem to point. The student
should investigate the issues if he would know
the meaning of the war, but, if he wishes to see
something of the conscious attitude which the belligerents
take toward the situation, perhaps no more
profitable way can be found than in a study of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>events through which the issues have been writing
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conflict of Russia and Japan was foreshadowed
already in the middle of the past century,
when the former began to claim some of the Kurile
Islands and the whole of Sakhalien, upon parts of
which Japan had long exercised vague sovereign
rights.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Presently, in 1858, Muravieff “Amurski”
succeeded in creating a common proprietary right
with China over the vast territory lying between the
Ussuri River and the sea.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> The same territory was,
only two years later, definitively annexed<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> to Russia
through the skillful diplomacy of Ignatieff, Russian
Minister at Peking, who, taking advantage of China’s
defeat at the hands of the allied forces of England
and France, had won the favor of the Chinese Government
by acting as mediator between it and the
allies. The Eastern naval headquarters of Russia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>which had been transferred from Peterpavlofsk
in Kamchatka to Nicolaiefsk at the mouth of the
Amur, was now again moved further south to Vladivostok,
founded in 1860, at the southern end of
the new territory. No sooner did the remote but
certain pressure from the expanding northern Power
begin to be felt in Japan than, in 1861, a Russian
man-of-war took possession of the Japanese islands
of Tsushima in the Korean straits, from which it
withdrew only at the instance of the British Minister,
Sir Rutherford Alcock.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Half a dozen years
after, the island of Sakhalien was placed under
a common possession between Russia and Japan,
while, in 1875, the island was surrendered to Russia,
Japan receiving in return the chain of sterile
Chishima Islands (the Kuriles).<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a> This brought the
presence of Russia still nearer home to Japan than
before. On the other hand, Russia seemed to have
only begun her ambitious career in Eastern Asia,
for she could hardly be expected to be forever satisfied
with her naval headquarters at Vladivostok,
a station which, situated as it was at the southern
extremity of her Oriental dominion, was so completely
ice-bound during a large part of each year
that her fleet was obliged to winter in Japanese
harbors.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Then followed a comparatively long period of
inactivity on the part of Russia. When, however,
in 1891, she finally resolved to build the trans-Siberian
Railway, the inadequacy of Vladivostok,
not only as the Pacific naval harbor of the Russian
Empire, but also as the terminus of the great
railroad, became evident. To Russia a southern
expansion toward an ice-free outlet seemed now a
necessity. For the realization of this desire, an opportunity
presented itself in a striking form, in
1895, at the end of the Chinese-Japanese war.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to obtain a clear understanding of this
situation, it is necessary to return to the outbreak
of hostilities and thence trace the evolution of Chinese
diplomacy up to their close. At the unexpected
dispatch of large forces by Japan to Korea,
in June, 1894, the Chinese Government appealed
to some foreign Ministers at Peking to bring pressure
to bear upon Japan to withdraw her troops
from the Peninsula. The Russian Minister is said
to have observed that Russia would not be prepared
to organize an armed coercion until Japan endeavored
to exercise actual control over the Korean
Kingdom, but might undertake to tender friendly
advice to Japan to withdraw. England was reluctant,
but as an appeal was again made to the Powers,
she took the lead in persuading others to join in a
concert to stay Japan’s hand in Korea. The plan
was, however, frustrated by the emphatic refusal of
Germany to consider it. An ineffectual counsel was
then made to Japan by a few of the Powers individually,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>not to embark upon a war against China.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
A war, nevertheless, ensued, with a rare success
on the part of Japan. During the course of hostilities,
China seems to have more than once<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> avowed
her impotence and requested the Powers to intervene,
until her repeated reverses on land and the
well-nigh complete annihilation of her northern
squadron brought her to such straits that the
friendly Powers could no longer remain inactive.
Japan also intimated her willingness to negotiate
for peace. After the envoys whom China had sent
with insufficient powers had been twice refused by
Japan, Li Hung-chang, later to be joined by his
son-in-law, Li Ching-fang, arrived with plenary
powers at Shimonoseki, on March 19, 1895, where
he was received by the Japanese Plenipotentiaries,
Count Itō, Premier, and Viscount Mutsu, Foreign
Minister. It appears, however, that China had already
signified to certain Powers her suspicion that
Japan desired the cession of a territory on the Chinese
mainland. Before, therefore, Li Hung-chang
left the Chinese shores, the German Minister at
Tokio was instructed by his government to warn
the Japanese Foreign Office that certain Powers
had been contemplating assent to China’s appeal
to interfere, and that the demand for a cession of
territory on the continent would be particularly
calculated to provoke such an intervention.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>It was under these circumstances that negotiations
were opened between the Chinese and Japanese
Plenipotentiaries on March 20. It is unnecessary
here to recount the story of an abortive attempt
made on Li’s life by a fanatic, and of the consequent
armistice for twenty days. At Li’s recovery,
the Japanese terms for peace were proposed on
April 1, which with amendments became the basis
of the final Treaty<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> signed at Shimonoseki on
April 17. It provided, among other things, for the
absolute independence of Korea, the cession to
Japan of the Liao-tung Peninsula, Formosa, and
the Pescadores, and an indemnity of two hundred
million <em>taels</em>. Of the ceded territories, the Liao-tung
being situated, as it were, in a position to hold
a key at once to Peking, Manchuria, and Korea, its
cession to Japan was probably calculated, from the
latter’s point of view, first, to render any renewed
attempt of China to dominate Korea impossible,
and, secondly, to establish an effective barrier
against the southern expansion of Russia.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally, the progress of the peace negotiations
had been watched with keen interest by the European
Powers. Particularly alert was Russia, whose
press deprecated so early as March 31 the alleged
intention of Japan to secure territory on the mainland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and which, as soon as Li Hung-chang communicated
to her early in April the terms proposed
by Japan and appealed to her to interfere, discerned
in those terms a great turning-point of her own
career in the East. She must at once have realized
the grave danger to the entire future of her Eastern
policy from Japan’s occupation of the Liao-tung
Peninsula, as well as the immense advantages which
her own possession of the same territory would confer
upon herself. Nor did the Korean independence,
which the new treaty secured, fail to be interpreted
by the Russian press as an exclusive protectorate
to be exercised by Japan over the Kingdom. “Russia,”
wrote the <cite><span lang="ru-latn" xml:lang="ru-latn">Novoe Vremya</span></cite> about April 20,
“cannot permit the protectorate over Korea which
Japan has secured for herself by the conditions
of the treaty. If the single port of Port Arthur
remain in possession of Japan, Russia will severely
suffer in the material interest and in the prestige of
a Great Power.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> It was just the time to intervene.
China had shown herself impotent, and had appealed
for intervention, and Japan was an exhausted victor.
By one clever stroke Russia might coerce the
latter and ingratiate herself with the former. She
would, however, perhaps have thought twice before
she acted, had it not been for the active assistance
rendered to her by France and Germany.
At a council, it is said, Russian naval and military
authorities concluded that Russia alone could not
successfully combat Japan, which, however, might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>be coerced if Russia coöperated with France. An
active communication of views now ensued between
the Foreign Offices of St. Petersburg, Berlin, Paris,
and London. The diplomatic correspondence of the
day is still withheld from the public view, but it
is well-known that France readily acceded to the
Russian desire for a joint intervention, and Germany
suddenly changed her former attitude toward
Japan and allied herself with the two intervening
Powers; while Great Britain, which had more than
once acted in favor of China, altered her course to
the opposite direction by declining to admit that
Japan’s terms of peace were prejudicial to her own
interests. The reasons avowed by Germany and
France for their assistance to Russia would seem to
be rather unconvincing, unless one takes for granted
the existence of certain unexpressed motives for the
act. Germany claimed to have found in the terms
of peace a future menace to the political and economical
interests of Europe, for those terms “would
constitute a political preponderance of Japan over
China,” to use the language of “an evidently inspired
article” of the <cite>Cologne Gazette</cite>, “and would
exercise a determining influence on the development
of China’s economic condition, and of the
sway of Japan in that country. From this it is concluded
that Japan is endeavoring to post herself as
a sentry, as it were, before all the chief important
routes of China. As Japan commands, by Port
Arthur and Wei-hai-Wei, the approach to the Yellow
Sea, and, by Formosa and the Pescadores, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>chief commercial route to China, it is taken to be
desirous of encircling her with a firm girdle, in
order, if necessary, to seclude her completely
from the world. The European Powers, therefore,
wish to ward off in time any steps prejudicial to
their interests.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Nor did the reasons brought forward
by France seem to be more germane to her
own interests than those of Germany were to hers.
The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Débats</span></i> wrote, on April 31, that all the clauses
on the occupation of continental territory were impossible
for Europe to recognize. Moreover, Port
Arthur, with a strip of territory round it in the
hands of the Japanese, would be a menace for
the independence of Korea, as much as for the
security of Peking. The <cite>Temps</cite> also said that
Japan’s predominance over China, which would be
the ultimate result of the arrangement, was “a constant
menace for the interests of Europe. It was a
serious blow dealt at the rights of the immediate
adjacent Powers.... A European concert was
now a duty toward civilization.” Perhaps it is safe
to say that, so far as France was concerned, her
desire to oblige her political ally was a more real
ground for her coöperation with the latter than any
other presented in her press. As for Germany, her
Foreign Minister then remarked, it is said, that
Japan had never requited the favors Germany had
done her during the war, but had, on the contrary,
deliberately concluded with China a treaty containing
provisions not only excessively favorable to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Japan, but also prejudicial to the political and economic
interests of Europe. This remark, again,
hardly explains the suddenly changed attitude of
Germany. Perhaps it is well to surmise that there
existed deeper and more complex diplomatic reasons,
upon which it would be idle here to speculate. The
declination of Great Britain to join in the concert
may more easily be accounted for. China, which
she had at first favored, had not only been inclining
toward Russia, but had shown herself by her
incompetency less worthy of trust than the ambitious
Japan. The latter had also secured in the
treaty certain commercial and industrial privileges
in South China which would be even more advantageous
to Great Britain than to Japan, while, on
the other hand, the former had little reason to suppose
that Japan’s retention of the Liao-tung was
designed to imperil China and Korea. On the contrary,
the presence of Japan at the strategic position
on the mainland might prove an effective check
upon Russia, whose cause Great Britain was the
least inclined to advocate. She therefore stood
aloof from the joint intervention, and her conduct
provoked a bitter resentment in the Russian and
French press.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of intervention seems to have matured
between Russia, France, and Germany by April 20,
and, on April 23, their representatives at Tokio separately
presented brief notes at the Foreign Office.
These notes, accompanied as they were by the verbal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>profession of each of the Governments, particularly
the German, of its friendly motive in the act,
intimated that Japan’s retention of the territory was
considered by them as not only imperiling the
Chinese Capital, but also making the Korean independence
illusory, and, consequently, prejudicial to
the permanent peace of the Far East.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The treaty
of Shimonoseki had been signed on April 17, and
the exchange of its ratifications fixed for May 8.
The Japanese Government had to answer the three
Powers within the fifteen days between April 23
and May 8, for, whatever its decision regarding the
Liao-tung, it would be unwise to postpone the ratification
of the treaty with China.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> In the mean time,
the Eastern fleets of the three Powers were augmented
and concentrated, and made ready, if need
be, for an immediate and concerted action, Russia
going even so far as to prepare the army contingents
in the Amur region for quick mobilization. Unknown
as it was how thoroughly the Powers were
determined, in case Japan should refuse to consider
their counsel, to appeal to force of arms, none the
less real was their idea of coercion, as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>exhaustion of Japan’s resources. On the other hand,
the common interests of Japan, Great Britain, and
the United States had not developed to such an
extent as to justify their united resistance against
the intervening Powers. Japan seems to have complied
with the Powers’ wishes so far as to agree to
retrocede the Liao-tung save the small peninsula of
Kin-chow containing Port Arthur, but the Powers
declined for evident reasons to accede to the proposed
compromise. The British Foreign Minister
also urged Japan to make to the susceptibilities of
Europe all concessions compatible with her dignity
and her permanent interests.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a> The Japanese Government,
after holding repeated conference before the
Throne and with military councilors,<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a> definitely
resolved, on May 4, to relinquish, for an additional
monetary consideration from China,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> all of the Liao-tung.
Evidently time was too limited and the occasion
too inopportune for Japan successfully to
induce China to pledge not to alienate in the future
any part of the retroceded territory to another
Power. On May 10, the entire nation of Japan beheld
with deep emotions the simultaneous publication
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>of the treaty of Shimonoseki, which had been
ratified in its original form, and of a special Imperial
decree countersigned by all the Ministers of the
Cabinet, announcing that a desire to insure a permanent
repose of the Orient had compelled Japan
to go to war, and that the same desire had now
prompted the three Powers to tender to Japan their
present friendly counsel, which the Emperor, for
the sake of peace, had accepted.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The historical significance of this memorable incident
deserves special emphasis. It is not too much
to say that with it Eastern Asiatic history radically
changed its character, for it marks the beginning
of a new era, in which the struggle is waged no
longer among the Oriental nations themselves, but
between sets of interests and principles which characterize
human progress at its present stage, and
which are represented by the greatest Powers of the
world. China’s position as a dominant exclusive
force was no sooner overthrown in Korea than it
was replaced by that of another power of a like
policy and with aggressive tendencies. Moreover,
the area opened to the advance of Russia covered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>not only Korea, but also Northern China and beyond,
and the new aggressor was the very power
which had thirty years before created a restless
feeling among the Japanese, by extending toward
them through Primorsk and Sakhalien its already
enormous contiguous dominion. The influence of
Russia was now brought face to face with that of
Japan, each with a promise to extend against, and
perhaps to clash with, the other. With the movement
of Russia there traveled from Europe to East
Asia her sympathetic relations with France, while
against this practical alliance stood the increasing
common interests and sympathies of Japan, Great
Britain, and the United States; Germany remaining
as a free lance between the two groups of Powers.
This remarkable accession, in both area and agents,
of the new activity in the East was heralded in,
to all appearance, not gradually, but with a sudden
sweep. And gravely ominous was its opening
scene, representing at once a pretended good-will
toward a feeble empire and an armed coercion of a
proud nation whom coercion would only stimulate
to greater ambition.</p>

<p class='c007'>It now remains for us to interpret the effects
wrought upon Japan by the intervention of the
three Powers, for the sentiment of the nation seems
to be so universally and persistently misunderstood
as to have caused even some of the natives to misconstrue
their own feelings. It is generally supposed
that the conduct of the Powers in depriving Japan
of her prize of victory excited in her breast a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>feeling of revenge, but this view seems to evince
too slight an understanding of the characteristics
of the nation. Also, the prevailing sense of pity
manifested by friendly foreigners toward Japan for
her alleged misfortune appears entirely misplaced,
for, on the contrary, she has derived an inestimable
benefit from the experience. Let us explain. The
most obvious lesson drawn by the best minds of
Japan, and unconsciously but deeply shared by
the entire nation, was neither that the Powers were
acting upon a principle altogether different from
their professed motive, for that was too plain to
every one; nor that she must some day humiliate
the very Powers which had brought coercion upon
her, because it was well known that their self-interest
had demanded it, as hers would, were she in
their place. Japan suddenly awoke to an absorbing
desire which left little room for the question of
national revenge. It became to her as clear as daylight
that the new position she had acquired in the
Orient by her victory over China could be maintained,
and even her independence must be guarded,
only by an armament powerful enough to give her
a voice among the first Powers of the world. If
she would not retire into herself, and finally cease
to exist, she must compete with the greatest nations,
not only in the arts of peace,<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a> but also in those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>war. Moreover, a far vaster conflict than she had
ever known in her history, excepting the Mongol
invasion of the thirteenth century, was seen to be
awaiting her. It is perhaps characteristic of modern
Japan that she scarcely has time to breathe. The
only course to save her seemed to be, now as at any
other recent crisis of her life, to go forward and
become equal to the new, expanding situation. As
soon as her supremacy in the East was assured,
Japan thus found herself confronted with a task
hitherto almost unpremeditated, and henceforth began
an enormous extension of her military forces,<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a>
as well as a redoubled activity in all other lines of
national progress.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>What is less obvious, but still more important,
is—it is questionable if there is in the entire
range of Japan’s national life another point less
understood abroad but more essential for an insight
into the present and future of the Extreme Orient
than this—the increased enthusiasm of Japan in
her ardent effort to strengthen her position in the
world by basing her international conduct upon
the fairest and best-tried principles of human progress.
The effort is not free from occasional errors,
but the large issue grows ever clearer in Japan’s
mind. A study of her past would seem to convince
one with overwhelming evidence that her historic
training has produced in Japan moral and material
characteristics eminently fit for the pursuit of such
a policy. However that may be, the subsequent
evolution of her interests at home and abroad
seems, by a fortunate combination of circumstances,
to have irrevocably committed her to this course;
for not only does a common policy along these lines
draw her and the Anglo-Saxon nations closer together,
but it is therein also that the vital promise
of her future seems to lie.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> And it may be added,
the consciousness of this powerful unity of moral
and material life seems to have infused a thrilling
new force into that historic love of country of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Japanese nation.<a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> It is to the intervention of 1895
and the situation that ensued that Japan owes the
hastening of all these results.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Regarded, however, from a broader point of view,
no one could predict a happy consequence of so
ominous a beginning, as has been described, of the
new Eastern situation. By her successful intervention,
Russia had conferred upon China a signal
favor, for which a reward was expected; but the
reward, again, assumed such a form that it at the
same time served as a new favor looking toward a
fresh reward, so that the final resultant of the
repeated process proved altogether out of proportion
to the initial deed of patronage. The first
step of this process was a 4 per cent. loan<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> to
China of 400,000,000 francs at 94⅛, and payable
in thirty-six years, beginning with 1896.
Not only were these liberal terms attended by no
security, but also the interest was guaranteed by a
special edict of the Czar.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a> The loan was issued
principally from Paris in July, 1895,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> and the income
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was intended to cover one half<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a> of China’s
indemnity to Japan.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> In order to facilitate the transactions
in connection with this loan, as well as to
promote the commercial relations between Russia
and Eastern Asia, the Russo-Chinese Bank was
organized late in 1895. In August, 1896,<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> the
Chinese Government was induced to contribute
5,000,000 <em>taels</em> toward the capital of the Bank,
which seem to have been paid out of the new loan.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
Later in the same year, Prince Ukhtomsky, president
of the Bank, who had come to Peking with an
immense number of costly presents to be distributed
among the members of the Court, succeeded in
securing the consent of the Chinese Government to
the Statutes of the Bank, which were subsequently
published on December 8.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The privileges of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>institution as enumerated in these Statutes included
the receiving of tax returns, management of local
finances, coining, payment of the interests of the
public bonds, and construction of railways and
telegraph lines in China, in so far as concessions
should be made by her Government to the Bank.
The latter now has more than thirty branches and
agencies in East Asia, and this professedly private
corporation has since proved to be a great instrument
through which the Russian Government has
obtained from China enormous concessions in
Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before we examine the nature of these concessions,
it is important to observe what took place
between Russia and China through the official
channels. On March 27, 1896, the Eastern world
was startled to see the publication in the <cite>North
China Daily News</cite> of a treaty of defensive alliance
concluded earlier in the same year between Russia
and China. The Japanese Government had already,
on March 16, been assured by the Foreign Office
at St. Petersburg that the treaty did not exist.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a> It
is not clear whether the denial referred to the particular
treaty in question or to any treaty of alliance
whatsoever. However that may be, the reported
agreement<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a> was of the most serious character, as will
be gathered from the following abstract. In recognition
of the service rendered by Russia regarding
the matter of the Liao-tung Peninsula and of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>loan, the Chinese Emperor desired to conclude with
Russia a treaty of alliance; and, consequently, it
was agreed, in secrecy, that, if Russia should come
in conflict with other Asiatic Powers, she should be
allowed to make free use of any port or harbor on
the Chinese coast, and, in case of urgent need, levy
troops from among the Chinese people. If a protest
should be made by other Powers, China should
answer that she was powerless to resist Russian
demands. If she should desire even to render active
assistance to Russia against the common enemy, she
might do so, but this point required further discussion.
In view of the great disadvantages of the ice-bound
naval harbors of Russia, China agreed to
allow her in time of peace a free use of Port Arthur,
or, if the other Powers should object, of Kiao-chau.
If the latter should be found inadequate, Russia
might choose any harbor on the coast of Kiang-su
and Che-kiang. If, on the other hand, China should
be at war with another Power, Russia should endeavor
to effect a compromise between the belligerents,
and, if the effort should fail, it should be the
duty of Russia openly to assist China and thereby
strengthen the alliance between the two Powers. In
regard to Manchuria, Russian military officers should
be free to travel along the eastern frontiers of the
Sheng-king and Kirin Provinces and to navigate
the Yalu and other rivers, the object being either to
further trade or to patrol the frontiers. When the
Siberian Railway was completed, a branch line might
be constructed under the joint control of China and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Russia, passing through the Provinces of Heilung
and Kirin, and reaching Talien or some other place
selected by Russia. In order to protect this line,
Russia might possess near Talien-wan an island and
the opposite shore, fortify them, and station there
her squadron and military forces. If a war should
arise between Russia and Japan concerning Korea,
China should allow Russia to send her troops toward
the Yalu, so as to enable them to attack the western
boundary of Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>No matter whether any treaty of alliance had
been signed between China and Russia early in
1896, significant events soon followed which gave
rise to rumors of grave import. When it was resolved
by China to send Wang Tsz-chun to St.
Petersburg as special envoy to attend the coronation
of the Czar, which was to take place in May
of the same year, M. Cassini, Russian Minister at
Peking, is said to have intimated that no one but
Li Hung-chang was acceptable to Russia as the
representative of the Chinese Emperor. Li’s pro-Russian
proclivities had been well known, but he
had up to this time been in disgrace for having
concluded the treaty of Shimonoseki so unfavorable
to China. He now regained his favor with the
Court, and started on his mission to Russia, presumably
taking with him the draft of the Russo-Chinese
convention which M. Cassini had framed.
The convention is reported to have been signed,
to avoid suspicion of other Powers, not at St.
Petersburg, but at Moscow, and, on the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>side, not by M. Lobanoff, Foreign Minister, but by
M. Witte, Minister of Finance. When, however,
the agreement was referred to the Yamên at Peking
for ratification, a large majority of the Chinese
Ministers are said to have disapproved the terms of
Li’s treaty, until the strenuous efforts of M. Cassini
turned the tide and the convention was ratified by
the Emperor on September 30, 1896. This is the
celebrated “Cassini Convention.”<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a> Let us now examine
the more important of its contents. The preamble
explicitly referred, as also did the treaty of
alliance already summarized, to the favors done to
China by Russia at the close of the recent war.
The body of the convention falls, in its substance,
into two large divisions, namely, the Articles (1–6)
relating to railway concessions in Manchuria, and
those (8–11) in regard to the disposition of certain
ports on the Chinese littoral. Russia was allowed
to extend the Siberian Railway to Vladivostok
across Manchuria <em>via</em> Aigun, Tsitsihar, Petuna,
Kirin, and Kun-chun (Art. 1). As regards the projected
Chinese railroad between Shan-hai-kwan and
Mukden, if China should find it inconvenient to
build it, Russia might furnish capital and construct
the line, China reserving to herself the option of
buying it after ten years of Russian management
(Art. 2). Another Chinese line in contemplation
between Shan-hai-kwan and Port Arthur and Talien-wan
<em>via</em> Niu-chwang, and its appurtenances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>should be built in accordance with the general railway
regulations of Russia (Art. 4). The fifth Article
was striking: All the railways built by Russia
in the Chinese territory were to be protected by
the local Chinese authorities, but in the more remote
regions, where the necessary protection was
not available, Russia was allowed, in order to afford
a better protection to her railroad and property, to
station special battalions of Russian infantry and
cavalry. Regarding the ports, it was agreed that
Russia might lease Kiao-chau for fifteen years for
the use of her squadron, but, in order to avoid suspicion
by other Powers, she should not immediately
occupy the harbor or seize the points commanding
it (Art. 9). In view of the strategic importance of
Port Arthur and Talien-wan and their adjacent territories,
China should in haste provide for their
adequate defense and repair their fortification, and
Russia should render all necessary aid for the protection
of the two harbors, and should not allow
any other Power to attack them; if, for urgent
necessity, Russia should engage in a war, China
should allow her, to enable her to attack the enemy
and defend her own position with greater
ease, temporarily to concentrate her military and
naval forces in those harbors (Art. 10). So long,
however, as Russia was not involved in hostilities,
China should retain all rights in the control of
Port Arthur and Talien-wan, and Russia should
not interfere with them in any manner (Art. 11).
In addition to these Articles, it was provided that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>if China should desire to reorganize the entire
army of Manchuria on the European basis, she
should engage the services of Russian military instructors
(Art. 8). In the matter of mining, Russian
and Chinese subjects might, with the consent
of local authorities, work all kinds of minerals in
the Heilung and Kirin Provinces, and in the Long
White Mountains (Art. 7).</p>

<p>COUNT CASSINI<br /><br /><em>Russian Minister at Washington, and formerly at Peking</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Such are the contents, in brief, of the much debated
“Cassini Convention,” the existence of which
has been as often alleged as denied. The reported
document may well be unauthentic, at any rate in
several important particulars. Its main interest consists,
however, not so much in the question of its
literal authenticity, as in the important facts, (1)
that the subsequent course of events is largely foreshadowed
in its contents, and (2) that high Russian
authorities have obtained, or at least claimed, certain
privileges which cannot be found in all the
other Russo-Chinese contracts that are known to
us, but are in one way or another reflected in the
present convention. The universal belief in the
diplomatic world appears to be that, if the published
text of the Cassini Convention is untrustworthy,
some of its substance must have been contained in
an agreement which Li Hung-chang signed in Russia
in 1895, and in some later secret agreements.
Nor is it impossible to substantiate this belief from
evidence of undoubted authenticity. Thus M. Pavloff,
the Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i> at Peking,
said, on October 8, 1897, to Sir Claude MacDonald,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the British Minister, that “shortly after the return
of Li Hung-chang from his mission to St. Petersburg,
the Chinese Government had informed the
Russian Minister that they had up intention of
continuing the Northern line [beyond Shan-hai-kwan
toward Kirin], but if at any time they did
continue it, owing to the particularly friendly relations
existing between the Russian and Chinese Governments,
they would in the first instance address
themselves to Russian engineers and employ, if
necessary, Russian capital.”<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a> It will at once be observed
that this closely corresponds to Article 3 of
the Cassini Convention. On this ground, M. Pavloff
considered it a “contravention of the agreement”<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a>
on the part of the Chinese Government
that the latter allowed British subjects, on June 7,
1898, to furnish capital and the chief engineer for
the extension of the Northern line, and, repeatedly
and in a manner highly irritating to the British and
Chinese Governments, demanded the replacement
of Mr. Kinder and his staff with Russian engineers.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
It was again in the same spirit that Russia
succeeded in inducing England to insert in the additional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>clauses of the Anglo-Russian railway agreement
of April 28, 1899, a statement to the effect
that the Russians might extend the Manchurian
Railway in a southwesterly direction through the
region traversed by the Northern Chinese line built
with British capital,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Count Muravieff explaining
that M. Witte attached importance to the insertion
of this clause.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Well he might, for no sooner
was the Agreement concluded than Russia pressed
China, though without success, for the concession
for a railway reaching directly to Peking itself.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a>
Again, if the provision in the Cassini Convention
that China should with all haste repair the fortification
of Port Arthur, with the assistance of Russia,
and, in case of necessity, turn it over to the use of
the latter’s fleet (Art. 10), was false, it was not long
before Count Muravieff could declare, in December,
1897, that an “offer” had been made by the Chinese
Government to allow the Russian squadron to winter
at the port.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a> More significant still was M. Pavloff’s
remark to Sir Claude MacDonald, that “he must tell
him frankly that the Russian Government intended
that the provinces of China bordering on the Russian
frontier must not come under the influence of
any nation except Russia.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Sir Claude pointed out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>that Kirin, the probable terminus of the extension
line, to which M. Pavloff had objected, was more
than two hundred miles from the Russian frontier,
but the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> had evidently marked out the entire
Manchurian provinces as a Russian sphere of influence.
It may be said that this claim even exceeded
the Cassini Convention and verged to the less trustworthy
treaty of alliance. The attention of the
reader may, however, be called to a still more direct
evidence than the veiled remarks of M. Pavloff. In
the official statement accompanying the text of the
Russo-Chinese Convention of April 8, 1902, which
was published in the <cite>Official Messenger</cite> of April
12, occur the following words: “The Chinese Government,
on their side, confirm all the obligations
they have previously undertaken toward Russia,
and particularly the provisions of <em>the 1896 agreement</em>,
which must serve as a basis for the friendly
relations of the neighboring Empires. By this
<em>defensive agreement</em>, Russia undertook in 1896
to maintain the principle of the independence and
integrity of China, who, on her side, gave Russia
the right to construct a line through Manchuria,
and to enjoy the material privileges which are directly
connected with the above undertaking.”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a> It
is impossible to find any one contract concluded in
1896 which either might be considered a “defensive
agreement” or contains the points enumerated in
the quoted passage. The so-called Cassini Convention
alone contains the provisions about the railway,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>as well as Articles 9 and 10, which may be said to
“maintain the principle of the independence and
integrity of China.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> The coincidence becomes
even more striking when we consider, together with
the Convention, the reported treaty of defensive
alliance of 1896, which may be regarded, if any,
the preliminary plan of the Convention. It is also
interesting to note that when Dr. George Morrison,
the noted Peking correspondent of the <cite>Times</cite>, had
an interview with Prince Ching on March 19, 1901,
and directly referred to the supposed existence of
a series of secret agreements between Russia and
China, beginning with the one which Li Hung-chang
negotiated during his mission in St. Petersburg,
the Prince “assented without the slightest
demur.”<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a> Finally, we are in possession of a vague
statement made by Count Cassini himself, who, in
1904, referred to the treaty “giving to Russia railroad
and other concessions in Manchuria,” which,
said he, “I had the honor to negotiate [at Peking]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>in behalf of my Sovereign.”<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> The agreement of
September 8, 1896, to which we shall presently
turn, “giving railway and other concessions in
Manchuria,” was concluded between the Chinese
Minister at St. Petersburg and the Russo-Chinese
Bank, and, unless Count Cassini negotiated it at
Peking at the same time that the Chinese Minister
did at the Russian capital, it may be inferred that
the former, in his quoted statement, referred to a
“Cassini Convention.” It is not at all impossible,
however, that both he in China and Mr. Hu in Russia
took part in the negotiations which resulted in
the conclusion of the agreement of September 8,
1896.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking all these indications together, it seems
almost safe to aver that at least two important
items of concessions—namely, railway grants and
the use of some ports for strategic purposes—must
in some form have been secured by Russia after
1896, and before the actual lease of Port Arthur
and Talien-wan in 1898. It is needless to say that
these two objects, railways and ports, possessed a
political meaning of the greatest moment, the ports
affording the Russian navy a commanding point on
the Pacific coast, and the railways ultimately connecting
that point with the army bases in Siberia
and European Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these two items, it was the railways that first
emerged from the state of a preliminary to that of
a final agreement between Russia and China. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>it was here that the Russo-Chinese Bank played a
great rôle for the Russian Government, for the
Agreement of August 27 (September 8), 1896,<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a> providing
for the construction by the Russians of a
railway through Manchuria connecting the Trans-Baikal
and South Ussuri lines of the Siberian railway
system, was concluded between the Chinese
Minister at St. Petersburg and the Bank. The latter
undertook to organize the Eastern Chinese<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a>
Railway Company with its accounts separate from
those of the Bank (Art. 1). It is instructive to note
that it is stated in the preamble of this Agreement
that the Chinese Government “intrusted”<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a> the
Bank to undertake the construction of the line, and
that the government agreed to contribute 5,000,000
<em>taels</em> toward the capital of the Company.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Russian troops should be transported by the railway
without obstruction and at half-fare (Arts. 8
and 9). Upon the basis of this Agreement were promulgated
by the Government of the Czar Statutes<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
providing for the construction and operation of the
railway. Nothing can better betray than these two
documents, the Agreement and the Statutes, that
the enterprise was only in a very limited sense an
undertaking of a private company. In the first
place, the capital of the Company was divided into
share-capital and bond-capital, the former, not guaranteed
by the Russian Government, being limited
to only 5,000,000 rubles, while the latter, which
was officially guaranteed, could be indefinitely
expanded according to necessity.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a> It in fact had
already before the present war swollen to the enormous
sum of over 270,000,000 rubles.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> In the second
place, the operation of the railroad was placed
upon the uniform basis of the Siberian system, and
under the management of a board whose nominal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>president was a Chinese,<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a> but whose vice-president,
who was to assume the actual direction, was
under the supervision of the Minister of Finance.<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a>
Finally, but not the least in importance, was the
provision regarding the protection of the railway
and its employees and the policing of the lands
assigned to the road and its appurtenances. The
former duty was to be performed by the Chinese
Government, but the latter “was confined to police
agents appointed by the Company. The Company
shall for this purpose draw up and establish police
regulations.”<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a> In these police agents, ostensibly to
be employed by the Company, one may discern the
origin of the famous “railway guards,” later called
the “frontier guards,” whose existence has become
an important problem since 1902 in connection with
the Russian evacuation of Manchuria. It should
also be noted that this provision concerning the
police agents does not appear in the corresponding
Article in the text of the Agreement between
China and the Bank, upon which the Statutes were
based, so that one is at a loss to know what was the
conventional ground for this Russian law, unless,
indeed, it was the so-called Cassini Convention,
which was alleged to have provided for the organization
of Russian infantry and cavalry battalions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in order to protect Russian interests in the more
remote parts of Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was agreed that the line should, after eighty
years, come under the possession of the Chinese
Government, which might also buy up the road and
its appurtenances after thirty-six years.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> It is interesting
to see that it also provided that during the
eighty years of Russian management, all commodities
carried between China and Russia by the railway
should pay in China duties one third less than the
ordinary import and export duties in that Empire,<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
a provision hardly reconcilable with the open door
principle, and explicitly contrary to the principles
proposed by the United States to the Powers two
years later.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Eastern Chinese Railway Company was organized
in February, 1897, and the first sod of the
Manchuria Railway was cut with great ceremony
on the eastern frontier of the Kirin Province on
August 28, 1897.</p>

<p class='c007'>To some this railway concession may have appeared
at first to have been intended merely to reduce
the time and expense of completing the eastern section
of the Siberian Railway by allowing it to pass
across Manchuria through a route shorter and easier
than the one along the Amur and Ussuri rivers.
Such a belief was, however, soon dispelled, or rather,
modified, by the acquisition by Russia of the lease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of the greatest naval harbor in the Yellow Sea, and,
simultaneously, of the right to join this naval basis
by a new railway with the main Manchurian line,
so as to make complete the connection between Port
Arthur and the army centres in Siberia and Russia.
The Russian lease of this port was, however, preceded
by and modeled after the German lease of
Kiao-chau, which should therefore receive our brief
attention first.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>KIAO-CHAU</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Kiao-chau, in the Province of Shan-tung, was, as
will be remembered, a port marked in the so-called
Cassini Convention for the use of the Russian squadron.
Its value as a commercial and strategical <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point
d’appui</span></i>, as well as the greatness of the mineral
wealth of Shan-tung, must have been as well known
to the Germans as to the Russians.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> How it happened
that Russia forsook this important position,
or, more accurately, how Germany succeeded in securing
its lease without a protest from Russia, still
remains to be explained. It is known, however, that
the offers which had been made by China, perhaps
in recognition of Germany’s service in the Liao-tung
affair,<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> of a docking and coaling station on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>southern coast, had been declined by Germany;<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a>
and also that Germany’s own attempts to secure a
point on the Lappa Island near Amoy, and later in
Amoy itself, had never materialized. As to Kiao-chau;
the desire of Germany for its possession had
henceforth been often observed by the Chinese
Minister at Berlin,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a> but, for the realization of the
desire, either the time was not ripe, or the susceptibilities
of Russia had to be considered. Toward
the latter half of 1897, however, the German Government
seemed to have concluded that a general
partition of China was now a likelihood, for
which emergency Germany should prepare herself
by obtaining a powerful foothold on the littoral.
Observe the following statement made, in a retroactive
manner, after the lease of Kiao-chau had
been acquired, by Herr von Bülow in the Reichstag,
on April 27, 1898: “Mention has been made of
the partition of China. Such a partition will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>brought about by us, at any rate. All we have done
is to provide that, come what may, we ourselves shall
not go empty-handed. The traveller cannot decide
when the train is to start, but he can make sure not
to miss it when it does start. The devil takes the
hindmost.... In any case, we have secured in
Kiao-chau a strategical and political position which
assures us a decisive influence in the future of the
Far East. From this strong position we can look
on with complacency on the development of affairs.
We have such a large sphere of action and such important
tasks before us that we have no occasion to
grudge other nations the concessions made them.
German diplomacy will pursue its path in the East
as everywhere else—calmly, firmly, and peacefully.
We will never play the part of mischief-maker; nor
will we play that of Cinderella.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a> Before this glorious
consummation was reached, Germany must have,
it is presumed, made diplomatic efforts to conciliate
Russia, and it is in this connection that it is alleged
by some that the two Powers then matured between
themselves a compromise whereby Germany should
not be molested in her possible attempt to seize
Kiao-chau at the first opportunity, and Russia, in
her turn, should be free to follow the precedent and
demand of China a lease of Port Arthur.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>However that may be, an opportunity for Germany’s
action came when, as is well known, two
German Catholic priests were murdered by a mob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>in the Kü-ye District, in Shan-tung, on November 1,
1897. The late Provincial Governor, Li Ping-hing,
who had recently been transferred to Sz-chwan,
was suspected of having instigated the crime. The
Peking Government at once ordered a strict search
for the culprits, and in three weeks the local authorities
succeeded in arresting four of the guilty
persons.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a> It was too late. Three German men-of-war
had arrived at Kiao-chau, about November 17,
to be joined later by several others, and landed
600 marines, who seized the Chinese barracks of
the port.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a> As the Tsung-li Yamên had received
no previous communication from the German authorities
regarding the demonstration, it “could
only surmise that Kiao-chau had been seized on
account of the murder of the German missionaries.”<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a>
The German Minister at Peking, Baron von
Heyking, then presented six demands, including
the punishment of the late Governor Li, an indemnity
for the murdered, and the preference for
German capital and engineers in the future railway
and mining enterprises in the Province of Shan-tung—the
desire for the lease of Kiao-chau being still
veiled,—and these demands were, with some modifications,
accepted by China. At this time, however,
Prince Henry of Germany, whom the Kaiser
had bade farewell at Kiel in his celebrated “mailed
fist” speech, was on his way to China with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>squadron. As soon as he arrived, Baron von Heyking
presented the long concealed demand for a
lease of the bay and the surrounding promontories of
Kiao-chau. In the face of the strong position and
forces commanded by Germany, China had no choice
but to yield.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a> When she was finally, on March 6,
1898, prevailed upon to sign the Agreement with
Germany, the Government of the latter declined to
publish anything but its first section containing the
use and lease of Kiao-chau,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> and the contents of
its other two sections concerning the railway and
mining privileges granted to Germany<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a> in the Shan-tung
Province, as well as a separate agreement
concerning the direct reparation for the crime of
Kü-ye, have not, so far as is known, been officially
given to the world from Berlin.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The act of Germany was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débâcle</span></i>, and in the
concessions she wrested from China were involved
questions of grave importance and far-reaching
consequences. In the first place, was not the lease
of a commanding port in reality an infringement
of the territorial sovereignty of the Chinese Empire?
In the second place, how could the preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>given to Germany in the future railway and
mining operations in one of the richest of the
eighteen Provinces be reconciled with the principle
of the equal opportunity for the economic enterprise
of all nations in China? If the action of
Germany could be, as it soon seemed to be, used
by other Powers as a precedent, would not the consequences
for the cause, to say the least, of the fair
treatment and mutual harmony in China of the
nations among themselves be disastrous? It is interesting
to observe the attitude taken toward this
incident by Great Britain, the Power which possessed
the greatest interest in insisting upon, as well
as strongest power to enforce, the two cardinal
principles of the world’s diplomacy in China, namely,
the territorial sovereignty of the Chinese Empire
and the equality therein of economic opportunity
for all nations. Official dispatches of the day clearly
indicate that, on the one hand, Germany made efforts
to allay the susceptibilities of Great Britain,
and that, on the other, the British remonstrances
were not only so mollified as to be ineffective, but
were also turned in such a direction as only to add
to the dangers of the situation. Let us observe how
this was done. It was repeatedly declared, during
the negotiations between Germany and China, by
the German Representatives at Peking and London
and by Herr von Bülow himself, that the northern
port of Kiao-chau had been chosen for its remoteness,
for one thing, from the regions in which England
was directly interested; that nothing was being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>done during the negotiations with China which
would be embarrassing to Great Britain; that Germany
was raising no objections to the British terms
of the Anglo-German loan to China now under consideration;
that the management of the new colony
would be found to be liberal, for the German Government
was convinced that the British system of
colonization was the right one; and that the Kaiser
and his Government were strong partisans of a good
understanding between Germany and England.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
Beside these assurances from Germany, it is interesting
to note that, on December 1, 1897, Sir
Claude MacDonald wrote from Peking to the Marquess
of Salisbury: “If the German occupation of
Kiao-chau is only used as a leverage for obtaining
satisfactory reparation ... for the murder of the
German missionaries, the effect on the security of
our own people will be of the best. If, on the other
hand, the German object is to secure Kiao-chau as
a naval station, under cover of their demands for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>reparation, it is by no means clear that their acquisition
of it will prejudice our interests.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Whether
or not this idea was indorsed by the British Government,
Sir Frank C. Lascelles, the Representative
at Berlin, said to Herr von Bülow, on December 30,
“That, so far as he knew, Her Majesty’s Government
had raised no objection to the German ships
going to Kaio-chau. Should, however, a demand
be put forward for exclusive privileges, or should
other countries seek to take possession of Chinese
ports, it would probably become necessary for Her
Majesty’s Government to take steps for the protection
of her vast interests in China.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a> In this last
sentence is seen a curse of China’s foreign relations,
that is, the idea of the balance of power—a
balance between foreign nations on her ground
and at her expense. An offending Power would
not retrace its steps, and another Power would virtually
recognize them by itself demanding counterbalancing
rights from China, which might expect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>other Powers also to follow suit with little regard
to her primary rights of sovereignty. Germany
could scarcely have felt the force of the British protest
which was, indeed, rather directed to China than
to Germany. The latter secured what she asked,
and made Kiao-chau as free a port as her treaty-tariff
system would allow;<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a> but German claims to
the sole right of railroad and mining concessions
in the province were speedily emphasized by the
organization of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schan-tung Eisenbahngesellschaft</span></i>,
with a capital of fifty-four million marks,
and also of the <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsche Bergbaugesellschaft</span></i>.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>PORT ARTHUR AND TALIEN-WAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As has been said, it appears impossible at the present
state of our knowledge to trace the exact connection
of Russia with the German occupation of
Kiao-chau.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a> What is of more direct interest to our
study, and is more easily established by evidence, is
the fact that, with the plea that she could not be
denied what had been granted to Germany,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a> Russia
closely followed the latter’s example,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> and, under
similar terms to hers,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a> demanded a lease of Port
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Arthur and Talien-wan, and also a railway concession
between a point in the Manchurian line granted in
1896 and the ports. Recent years have seldom seen
a situation so instructive of the character of the
Far Eastern diplomacy in general, and of Russia’s
method in particular, as the foreign relations in
China which culminated in the conclusion of the
Russo-Chinese Agreement of March 27, 1898.
These relations were also unusually complex, owing
to the position which England held therein, whose
vast interests in various parts of China were at
once brought in many-sided contact, not only with
Russia, but also with other Powers interested in
China.</p>

<p class='c007'>On December 20, 1897, a report reached the
British Foreign Office that three Russian men-of-war
had arrived at Port Arthur, and that three
others were expected at Talien-wan and three more
at Port Arthur.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Two days later it was officially
explained by Count Muravieff “that the step taken
was entirely a question of convenience for the
ships, and had absolutely no connection with the
occupation of the bay of Kiao-chau by Germany.”
The Count added “that there had always been a
difficulty about keeping more than a certain number
of men-of-war at a time in Japanese ports, and
that, consequently, the Imperial Government had
been glad to accept the offer of the Chinese Government
to allow the Russian squadron to winter
at Port Arthur. This arrangement was all the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>convenient as that port was within an easy distance
of Vladivostok, and had an arsenal where their
ships could undergo all necessary repairs. Moreover,
it was an advantage that Port Arthur was
quite free from ice in the winter, though this fact
was not so important now, as Vladivostok was at
present furnished with an exceptionally powerful
ice-breaker, which it was hoped would make that
port available for egress and ingress during the
winter months. In fact, Vladivostok remained, as
heretofore, their centre in the Far East, and the
headquarters of their land and sea forces, so that
the mere fact of the Russian squadron wintering
at Port Arthur made no change whatever in the
situation.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a> On the same day that this pacific declaration
was made, it was reported, as it was later
confirmed by Chinese authorities, that Russia was
offering to China a 4 per cent. loan of 16,000,000
pounds at 93, an extremely favorable term, to pay
off the balance of the Japanese indemnity. The
suggested security was the income of the land tax
and <em>likin</em>, besides which Russia was said to have demanded
as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</span></i> all future railway concessions
in Manchuria and North China, as well as the
succession of a Russian subject to Sir Robert Hart
as Inspector-General of the Maritime Customs.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>was on this occasion that M. Pavloff, claiming that
the Tsung-li Yamên had promised to employ Russian
engineers and Russian capital in the construction
of any railway between the Great Wall and
the Russian frontier, undertook to record the alleged
promise and express his gratification, and,
seeing that the Yamên did not reply, took it for
granted that the matter was settled, and notified
the St. Petersburg Government to that effect.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Nor
did the Russian Representatives at Peking fail
thereafter to appeal to this agreement concluded by
M. Pavloff in so striking a fashion, whenever China
opened any discussion with another Power regarding
any subject connected with railways north of
Shan-hai-kwan. In the mean time, an Anglo-German
syndicate had made an offer, last June, of a
loan for the same purpose, and now Sir Claude
MacDonald strongly supported a scheme of a new
loan presented by the Hong-kong and Shanghai
Bank, a British concern, in competition with the
Russian proposals.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a> One of the terms of the British
loan as matured between the Bank, Sir Claude,
and the Marquess of Salisbury, was the opening of
Talien-wan to foreign trade.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The British Minister’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>intention obviously was, among other things,
to forestall the possible Russian occupation of this
port as well as Port Arthur.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a> The significance was
well understood by the Tsung-li Yamên, which was,
however, afraid to embroil China with Russia, for
the latter’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i> “had protested,
under instructions from his Government, against its
[Talien-wan’s] opening in the strongest manner,
and had warned the Yamên that it would incur the
hostility of Russia by doing so.”<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a> The reason for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>this strenuous opposition was, on January 19, 1898,
explained by the Russian Ambassador at London,
who “urged very strongly that if we [the British
Government] insisted on making Talien-wan an
open port, we should be encroaching on the Russian
sphere of influence, and denying her in the future
that right to the use of Port Arthur to which the
progress of events had given her a claim.” These
remarks were significant in showing how foreign
was the idea of the open door to the Russian policy
in Manchuria. When Lord Salisbury asked the
Ambassador, in the same interview, what possible
objection he could have to making Talien-wan a
free port if Russia had no designs on that territory,
the latter replied “that without any such designs
it was generally admitted that Russia might claim
a commercial <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débouché</span></i> upon the open sea, and that
in order to enjoy that advantage fully she ought
to be at liberty to make such arrangements with
China as she could obtain with respect to the commercial
régime which was to prevail there.” Here
is a clear indication that Russia had little faith
in the compatibility of other nations’ commercial
welfare in China with her own, or, in other words,
in the ability of her people and the efficiency of
their economic organization to compete with other
nations in an open market. Else, she would not
object to the opening of a port to the world’s trade.
Lord Salisbury reminded the Russian Representative
that “the most-favored-nation clause forbade
China to give Russia at Talien-wan more favorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>terms with regard to customs duties than she gave
to other treaty Powers.”<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a> England’s position,
which was repeatedly shown to Russia, was that it
was natural that Russia should open a port for
her commerce on the coasts of the North Pacific,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a>
but that it would be a contravention of the treaty
rights<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a> of other nations to make of the port an
exclusive market for Russian trade. Under these
persistent representations, Count Muravieff at last
declared, on January 28, through M. de Staal,
Ambassador at London, that any (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout</span></i>)<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> commercial
outlet secured by Russia “would be open to
the ships of all the great Powers, like other ports
on the Chinese mainland. It would be open to the
commerce of all the world, and England, whose
trade interests are so important in those regions,
would share in the advantage.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Then what was
meant by “open”? M. de Staal stated on February
10: “I cannot in any way anticipate the
decisions of my Government, which, in the event
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of acquiring an outlet in Chinese waters, naturally
remains free either to establish a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porto franco</span></i>
[i. e., a port where goods imported are exempt
from all import dues] there, or to assimilate the
port in question to the treaty ports of the Chinese
littoral.”<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> It will be seen later that, through the
Imperial Order of July 30 (August 11), 1899,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a>
Russia declared Dalny a “free port” in the sense
of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porto franco</span></i>, under certain conditions. In the
face of these elastic conditions, one would be slow,
in spite of the Order, to admit that the question
stated by M. de Staal in the quoted passage has
been definitively settled by his government one way
or the other, or in a third alternative.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this point, namely, about February 10,
1898, one can follow the gradual withdrawal of Lord
Salisbury’s position. He at first seemed to have accepted
Sir Claude MacDonald’s suggestion to insist
upon the opening of Talien-wan as a condition of
the British-Chinese loan, but, evidently at the Russian
opposition, presently contented himself with
giving the following instruction to the British Minister
at Peking: “You are not bound to insist
on making Talien-wan a treaty port if you think
it impracticable, though we give it up with regret.
Would it be possible to obtain a promise of such a
concession if ever a railway was made to that port?
You should maintain demand for opening of other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>ports.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a> Then, when the Chinese Government was
so pressed by the opposition of Russia and France
as to declare on January 30 that unless England
pledged herself to offer protection to China against
Russia, she could not consent to accept the loan,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a>
Lord Salisbury’s policy receded further than before.
He now made representations to Russia not to infringe
the most-favored-nation treatment in Talien-wan,
if she should lease the port. It is needless to say
that such a direct request to Russia was tantamount,
on the part of England, to abandoning the desire of
securing the opening of the port from China, which,
save for Russian threats, was willing to comply with
the desire; and to acquiescing in and even recognizing
Russia’s right to lease the port, instead of
opening it as a treaty port. Under these circumstances,
it was not strange that the British Government
was met by Russia with the ambiguous phrase,
“open port,” which, in spite of Lord Salisbury’s
attempt<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> to interpret it in the sense of a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porto
franco</span></i>, was found, in M. de Staal’s statement of
February 10, already quoted, to be still more uncertain
than it appeared when it was first declared.
Russia seemed to have gained all that England
lost, but it was a mere prelude to a far more serious
situation which was still to develop.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have been plain to any one, had he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>been susceptible to certain unmistakable signs, that
Russia’s desires in Manchuria were more extensive
than the mere acquisition of a lease of a commercial
outlet on the Yellow Sea. The same Count Muravieff,
who had said three weeks before that the presence
of Russian ships at Port Arthur late in 1897
was purely for the sake of wintering there, and that
the fact that Port Arthur was ice-free was not very
important, now declared, on January 12, 1898, that
when the Russian fleet had left the port, after wintering
there, the Chinese Government had given the
Russians a prior right of anchorage—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le droit
du premier mouillage</span></i>.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> The question so gently
broached was more clearly pronounced a week later,
when M. de Staal strongly maintained that the opening
of Talien-wan would result in an encroachment
upon the Russian sphere of influence, and in “denying
her in the future that right to the use of Port
Arthur to which the progress of events had given
her a claim.”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a> In the face of these official remarks,
it would be impossible to deny that Russia wished
to use, not only Talien-wan, but also Port Arthur,
and the latter for purposes clearly other than commercial.
Yet the British Government does not seem
to have taken any action in the matter, but, on the
contrary, its tacit recognition of Russia’s demand of
the lease of Talien-wan was not of a nature to discourage
her design upon Port Arthur. On February
14, China made concessions to Great Britain
regarding internal navigation, the non-alienation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the Yang-tsze Provinces, and the appointment of an
Englishman to the inspectorate-general of customs
so long as the British trade was preponderant in
China;<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> on the 19th, the preliminary agreement of
the British loan was signed;<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a> and March 6 saw the
conclusion of the German agreement concerning the
lease of Kiao-chau and privileges in the Province of
Shan-tung. Russia immediately seized this opportunity
in bringing forward her long cherished
design, for, on March 7, it was simultaneously reported
in the London <cite>Times</cite> and by Sir Claude MacDonald,
soon to be confirmed by the Tsungli-Yamên
and admitted by Count Muravieff, that M. Pavloff
was pressing the Peking Government to grant the
lease of Port Arthur and Talien-wan and the railway
concession from Petuna on the trans-Manchurian
Railway to the ports.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a> The report appears to have
made a profound impression upon the British Government,
which, on the day it was received, was
compelled to say that, if the Russian demands were
granted, “her influence over the Government of
Peking would be so increased, to the detriment of
that of Her Majesty’s Government, that it seemed
desirable for them to make some counter-move. The
best plan would perhaps be, on the cession of Wei-hai-Wei
by the Japanese [who had been holding it,
according to the treaty, pending the final payment
of Chinese indemnity], to insist on the refusal of a
lease of that port on terms similar to those granted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to Germany.”<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> This view was sounded, it is true,
to the British Minister at Peking, and not to the
Russian Government, but the latter was not to encounter
an effective protest from a government
which had so soon made up its mind that the protest
might fail and be compensated by itself reproducing
the evil at China’s expense.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> At any rate, Count
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Muravieff deemed it now safe to declare, beginning
with March 8, that no alternative had been left to
Russia, under the uncertainty attending the development
of affairs in the Far East and other circumstances,
but to demand a cession both of Talien-wan
and Port Arthur, the former only to be opened to
foreign trade; that one of these ports without the
other would be of no use to Russia, while the use
of both was of vital necessity to her; and that the
lease would not interfere with the sovereign rights
of the Chinese Empire. To the last pledge was
added, probably at the persistent representations of
England, that the treaty rights acquired by the
Powers in China would be respected.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The distinction made by Count Muravieff between
Port Arthur and Talien-wan at once brought
home to the British Government the gravity of the
situation. The first impulse on the part of Lord
Salisbury was to fall back upon M. de Staal’s statement
of February 10, that any (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout</span></i>) port which
Russia might acquire on the Chinese coast should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>open to the foreign trade.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Count Muravieff, however,
explained that the statement applied only to
Talien-wan, but no promise had been made regarding
Port Arthur.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a> On March 15, however, he was
authorized by the Czar to give to Sir N. O’Conor
“an assurance that both Port Arthur and Talien-wan
would be open to foreign trade, like other
Chinese ports, in the event of the Russian Government’s
obtaining a lease of these places from the
Chinese Government.” The Count intimated next
morning that it would be desirable for the British
Government not to repeat this assurance in the
House of Commons, for “it might be considered as a
want of courtesy toward the Chinese Government,
who had not yet formally agreed to give the Russian
Government a lease of the ports in question.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Presently, however, the British Government
awoke to the conviction that Port Arthur was “not
a commercial harbor,” and “it was doubtful whether
it could be converted into one.” “But,” stated the
Marquess of Salisbury, “though not a commercial
harbor, Port Arthur supplies a naval base, limited
indeed in extent, but possessing great natural and
artificial strength. And this, taken in connection
with its strategic position, gives it an importance in
the Gulf of Pechili and therefore at Peking, upon
which, in their representation to Japan at the close
of the war with China, the Russian Government
laid the greatest emphasis.... The possession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>even if temporary, of this particular position, is
likely to have political consequences at Peking of
great international importance, and the acquisition
of a Chinese harbor notoriously useless for commercial
purposes by a foreign Power will be universally
interpreted in the Far East as indicating that the
partition of China has begun.... It may, perhaps,
be proper to observe that a great military
Power which is conterminous for over four thousand
miles with the land frontier of China, including
the portion lying nearest to its capital, is never
likely to be without its due share of influence on
the councils of that country. Her Majesty’s Government
regard it as most unfortunate that it has
been thought necessary, in addition, to obtain control
of a port which, if the rest of the Gulf of Pechili
remains in hands so helpless as that of the sovereign
Power, will command the maritime approaches
to its capital, and give to Russia the same strategic
advantage by sea which she already possesses
in so ample a measure by land.”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a> In this spirit,
the British Government asked Count Muravieff
through Sir N. O’Conor, on March 23, to reconsider
the advisability of pressing demands upon
China in regard to Port Arthur. England would not
object to the Russian lease of an ice-free commercial
harbor connected by rail with the trans-Siberian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Railway, but questions of an entirely different kind
were opened if Russia obtained control of a military
port in the neighborhood of Peking. England,
on her part, was prepared to give assurances that
beyond the maintenance of the existing treaty
rights she had no interests in Manchuria, and to
pledge herself not to occupy any port in the Gulf
of Pechili as long as other Powers maintained
the same policy.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> To this protest, so plainly attended
by a second wish of Great Britain to make
a counter-move when the prime move of Russia
could not be checked, Count Muravieff made, on
March 23, a firm reply, refusing absolutely to admit
that the integrity of the Chinese Empire was violated
by the proposed lease of Port Arthur, and
repeating his assertion that the possession of that
harbor was a question of vital necessity to Russia.
Sir N. O’Conor confessed the futility of his protest.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a>
About the same day, M. Pavloff informed
the Peking Government that Russia could not consider
the question of Port Arthur and Talien-wan
apart, and insisted upon their lease before the 27th,
failing which, Russia would take hostile measures.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a>
Now England definitely resolved, on March 25, to
obtain speedily the lease of Wei-hai-Wei in terms
similar to those granted to Russia for Port Arthur,
and ordered the British fleet to proceed from Hong-kong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>to the Gulf of Pechili,<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> and, three days
later, notified the Russian Government that she
would retain her entire liberty of action to take
steps to protect her interests, and to diminish the
evil consequences which she anticipated.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> On the
preceding day, however, a Russo-Chinese Agreement
had been signed, incorporating all the points
upon which Russia had insisted and against which
England had vainly protested. Count Muravieff at
once briefly announced to the Powers the successful
conclusion of the Agreement;<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a> and, when the
British Government called upon him to fulfill his
promise to give a written assurance of Russia’s declared
intention to respect the sovereign rights of
China and the treaty privileges of the other Powers
in the leased territory, he calmly replied that what
was interpreted as promises was in fact “very confidentially”
expressed views, and that “the time was
not opportune” for making the assurances public.
Russia would not, he added, so “abuse the lease
granted by a friendly Power” as “to arbitrarily
transform a closed and principally military port
into a commercial port like any other.”<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> The triumph
of Russia was tardily followed, on April 3,
by the promise England secured from China to
lease Wei-hai-Wei to her for the same period as
Port Arthur,<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a> thus again substituting for an effective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>prevention of evils the “balance”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a> and retaliation
between the Powers at the expense of China.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>In this connection, it may be noted that the Russian
Government considered, according to Count
Muravieff, “that China owed them this [the lease
of the ports] for the services they had rendered her
in her war with Japan, and these services must be
properly requited.”<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a> It was no matter of surprise
to Japan that Russia now secured for herself the
most strategic portion of the territory, the retention
of which by Japan was, three years ago, declared by
the same Power to be imperiling the position of
Peking, rendering Korean independence nominal,
and interfering with the permanent peace of the
Far East. When it was announced by Russia, in
December last, that Port Arthur had been lent to
her by China only temporarily as a winter anchorage,
the Japanese Government merely “credited
this assurance, and accordingly took note of it.”<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a>
When the negotiations for the lease were in progress,
the Japanese Government made no protest,
and when they were consummated, it manifested no
appreciable sentiment. At the same time, it quietly
approved of the British lease of Wei-hai-Wei,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which the Japanese troops had still held pending
the final payment of the Chinese indemnity. Then
they speedily evacuated the port in favor of England,
leaving behind them every accommodation to
the successor.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Agreement concluded, on March 15/27,
1898, between Li Hung-chang and the Russian
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i>, M. Pavloff, has never been published by
the Russian Government, and the only sources to
which we can turn are an English translation of a
Chinese <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précis</span></i> forwarded by Sir Claude MacDonald
more than a month after the conclusion of the
Agreement,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> and the Chinese text that appears in

Arthur and Talien-wan, with their adjacent waters,
were leased to Russia for twenty-five years, subject
to renewal by mutual agreement, the lease not affecting
the sovereign rights of China (Articles 1
and 3); within the leased territory, Chinese citizens
might continue to live, but no Chinese troops should
be stationed, and the responsibility of military affairs
should be vested in one Russian officer, who
should not bear the Chinese title of governor-general
or governor (Article 4); Port Arthur would be
a naval port open only to the Russian and Chinese
men-of-war, but closed against the commercial and
naval ships of other nations, while Talien-wan, except
the portion used exclusively for naval purposes,
would be a trading port open freely to the merchant
vessels of all nations (Article 6); the Russians
would be allowed to build forts and barracks, and
provide defenses (Article 7); there should be a neutral
territory to the north of the leased ground, which
would be administered by Chinese officials, but into
which no Chinese troops should be sent without
consulting the Russian authorities (Article 5); the
railway contract of 1896 might be extended so as
to cover a branch line to Talien-wan and, if necessary,
another line between Niu-chwang and the
Yalu, but the construction of the railways should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>not be made a ground for securing territory (Article
8). Sir Claude Macdonald presented also, on June
14, what he believed to be an authentic version of
the Special Russo-Chinese Agreement concluded on
April 25 (May 7), 1898, to supplement the Agreement
of March 15.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> It defined the extent of the
leased territory, and of the neutral territory to the
north of the former (Articles 1 and 2).<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> Within
the latter, it was agreed, no ports should be open
to the trade of other nations, and no economic
concessions made to them, without Russian consent
(Article 5). At Kin-chow, the administration and
police were to be Chinese, but the military, Russian
(Article 4). Regarding railways, it was provided
that Port Arthur and Talien-wan should be the termini
of the conceded line, along which no railway
privileges should be given to other nations. Russia
would, however, have nothing to say if China herself
should undertake to construct a railway from
Shan-hai-kwan to a point near the Russian line
(Article 3).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>These agreements were accompanied by some
characteristically pacific and magnanimous utterances
by the Czar, professing his firm friendship
with China, extolling the wise decision of the Son of
Heaven in granting the lease, and emphasizing that
the direct communication by means of the great
Siberian Railway with the hitherto closed-up country
would largely contribute to the peaceful intercourse
of the peoples of the East and West, to which task
Russia was called by Divine Providence.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The leased territory was named Kwan-tung<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a> by
the Russians, and the Provisional Regulations for
its administration were published at St. Petersburg
through the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin des Lois</span></cite> of August 20 (September
1), 1899.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> By these regulations, the Kwan-tung
region was placed under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of War, with its chief seat of administration
at Port Arthur (Articles 4 and 6). The Administration
was headed by a Governor, appointed
and removed at the immediate will of the Czar, who
was also Commander-in-Chief of the army forces of
the territory and entered into immediate communication
with the commander of the cis-Amur region,
and in addition commanded the navy at Port Arthur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and Vladivostok; the latter port, however, retained
its Commander of the port, who was subservient to
the Governor (Articles 3, 7, 12, 13, and 14). In
matters concerning frontier and foreign relations,
the Governor directly communicated with the Russian
Representatives at Peking, Tokio, and Seul,
and with the Russian military and naval agents
(Article 22). At the creation on August 13, 1903,
of a Vice-regency in this region, which will receive
attention later, it became necessary to make some
changes in the administrative rules, which had not
been completed at the outbreak of the present war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Talien-wan being mainly open to foreign trade,
its organization and administration were set on a
separate basis from the rest of the Kwan-tung. At
the instance of M. Witte, then the Minister of
Finance, an Imperial Order was promulgated on
July 30 (August 11), 1899, ordering that near
Talien-wan a new town named Dalny should be
built, which was simultaneously declared a free
port under the following conditions, namely, that
the importation and exportation of merchandise
should be allowed free of customs dues in Dalny
within the limits determined, and liable to modification,
by the Minister of Finance; but that goods
imported into Russia from Dalny should pay the
regular import duties in force in the Russian Empire.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a>
By the Provisional Regulations already referred
to of August 20 (September 1) of the same
year, the organization of Dalny was assigned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the Eastern Chinese Railway Company, under the
chief direction of the Minister of Finance, and its
administration was intrusted to a Prefect, to be
appointed and dismissed by Imperial orders and
subordinate to the Governor of the Kwan-tung
(Articles 99 and 101).<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> It is already well known
that Dalny, now covering about 100 square versts
in area, was, according to M. Witte’s plan, intended
to be the commercial terminus of the great Siberian
Railway, and eventually the mercantile outlet
on the Pacific of the vast Russian Empire. Before
the war, the works at Dalny, including its large
docks and piers, had cost already nearly 20,000,000
rubles. Part of this immense expenditure was to
have been met by the income of the public sales at
auction of land-lots, held three times since 1902, in
spite of the fact that the twenty-five year lease of
the territory to Russia would hardly justify her in
alienating portions of it permanently.<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>SECRETARY HAY’S CIRCULAR NOTE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is unnecessary for us to describe how, between
1897 and 1899, other so-called spheres of influence
and of economic concessions than those already
mentioned were marked out in China by the Powers,
for, important as they are in the general history of
the modern East, they have little bearing upon our
immediate subject. It suffices to recall that the
process was begun by the German seizure of Kiao-chau;
that unfortunately Great Britain felt obliged
to have recourse to the policy of the balance of
power; and that no other “sphere” had the grave
significance and the evil forebodings of the Russian
territory of the Kwan-tung in Manchuria. It
was during this period that a Power whose position
was so unique as to justify the act appealed to
the other interested Powers, in September, 1899,
to make declarations that they would observe the
principle of the equal economic opportunity for all
nations in their respective spheres of interest in
China. The principle thus proposed by the United
States was stated to imply (1) non-interference with
the treaty rights and vested interests of each other;
(2) the maintenance of the Chinese treaty tariff,
except in “free ports,” under the Chinese management;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and (3) no differential treatment in the
harbor duties and railway charges, in the spheres.
The phrase “leased territory” was used in connection
with only the first of these three points,
while the words “spheres of interest” were applied
to all three, so that it was uncertain whether the
second and third points were intended by Secretary
Hay to cover the leases, as well as the spheres.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a>
In reply to this proposition, Great Britain, which
had stronger reason than the United States to indorse
a policy which had originated with her and
which she had long upheld in China at enormous
cost, and Japan expressed their unequivocal adherence
to the proposed principle. Germany, France,
and Italy also assented, all except Italy, however,
with the natural reservation that the desired declarations
would be made if all other interested Powers
acted likewise.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a> As regards the question whether
the three points applied to the leases and spheres
alike, it is interesting to note that Germany, France,
and Great Britain replied, in effect, in the affirmative,
Germany using the expression “its Chinese
possessions,” and France employing the phrase
“the territories which were leased to her.” The
statement used by Great Britain was the most
explicit and comprehensive, for she mentioned “the
leased territory of Wei-hai-Wei and all territory in
China which may hereafter be acquired by Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Britain, by lease or otherwise, and all ‘spheres of
interest’ now held, or that may hereafter be held
in China.” Beside these assurances, the Russian
assent was highly significant, which, with the reservation
similar to that of the other Powers, stated:
“As to the ports now opened, or hereafter to be
opened, to foreign commerce <em>by the Chinese Government</em>,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
and which lie <em>beyond</em> the leased territory
to Russia, the settlement of the question of customs
duties belongs to China herself, and the Imperial
Government [of Russia] has no intention whatever
of claiming any privileges for its own subjects to
the exclusion of foreigners.” But “in so far as the
territory leased by China to Russia is concerned,
the Imperial Government [of Russia] has already
demonstrated its firm intention to follow the policy
of the ‘open door’ by creating Dalny (Talien-wan)
a free port; and <em>if at some future time that
port, although remaining free itself, should be
separated by a custom-limit from other portions
of the territory in question</em>, the customs duties
would be levied, in the zone subject to the tariff,
upon all <em>foreign</em> merchants without distinction as
to nationality. With the conviction,” the Russian
note concluded, “that this reply is such as to ratify
the inquiry made in the aforementioned note [of
the United States], the Imperial Government is
happy to have complied with the wishes of the
American Government, especially as it attaches
the highest value to anything that may strengthen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and consolidate the traditional relations of friendship
existing between the two countries.”<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> On the
strength of the various replies from the Powers,
however, the United States Government considered
that “the Declaration suggested by the United
States on that subject [i. e., the proposals about
the Chinese trade] had been accepted by those
Powers,” and regarded the assent given by them
“as final and definite.”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a> It is interesting to note
that no Power made a formal declaration<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a> suggested
by Secretary Hay, who, however, seems to
have deemed the replies with reservations as equivalent
to such a declaration. It is problematical
whether this exchange of notes did in the slightest
degree have the effect of changing the actual situation,
at least so far as Russia was concerned.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>THE OCCUPATION OF MANCHURIA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have given only an incomplete account of the
manner in which certain Powers seemed, during the
years 1897 and 1898, to vie with one another in
transgressing, in effect, the principle of the territorial
integrity of the Chinese Empire, to which
they at the same time professed their adherence.
Another principle, however,—that of the open
door, or of the equal opportunity in China for the
commercial and industrial enterprise of all nations,—was,
as we have seen, not as openly ignored
even by the most aggressive Powers. The time arrived,
in 1900, when the observance of both principles
appeared to be the only safeguard against a
general partition of China and an internal revolution
through the length and breadth of the vast
Empire. The story of the Boxer trouble is too
fresh in every one’s memory to need to be retold.
It was during this insurrection, and during the
march of the allied forces toward Peking and the
long negotiations which followed it, that all
the Powers concerned repeatedly and unequivocally
pledged themselves to one another to maintain the
two cardinal principles of Chinese diplomacy. It
now belongs to us to relate, however, that it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>in the midst of this reiterated promise of fair play
that the most acute stage of the Manchurian question
was reached. Evidence is abundant to show
that Russia was inclined greatly to underestimate
the seriousness of the troubles in North China,
where a concerted action of all the interested
Powers was imperative, while in Manchuria, which
Russia had for years regarded as her sphere of influence,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
she carried forward aggressive measures
with great rapidity and on an enormous scale.
Thus, even so late as June 20, when the railway
communication of Peking with Tientsin had been
cut for three weeks;<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> when Prince Tuan and his
anti-foreign counselors swayed the Court, and the
Tsung-li Yamên had long proved utterly impotent
to cope with the situation;<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a> when the 6000 Chinese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>soldiers sent against the Boxers around Tientsin
betrayed themselves into inaction;<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a> when the
international relief corps of marines led by Admiral
Seymour had already been forced backward;<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
when the Boxers had at last poured into Peking<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
and held the foreigners in siege for a week, killing
many Chinese as well as the Japanese Chancellor
Sugiyama;<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> and when the Taku forts had been
taken by the allied squadron,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a> only to infuriate
the anti-foreign sentiment all over North China;<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
when no news had been received by him even from
Tientsin and Taku for the past four days,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> and after
he had dispatched 4000 Russian soldiers for the
disposal of M. de Giers at Peking,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a>—Count Muravieff
still held an optimistic view, and supposed that
the trouble would be over within two weeks, saying
that Middle and South China were under a greater
peril than the North.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> This last assertion, which he
made more than once,<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> is significant when we consider
that Middle and South China included regions
where British interests were predominant. Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Russia persistently declared her firm intention to
act in concert with other Powers in North China,
it is not altogether impossible to suppose, as it has
been alleged, that she was not unwilling to divert
the attention of Great Britain and others from North
China, where Russia would not have hesitated, if
possible, to render her sole assistance to China to
suppress the insurrection. At least, Russia declared
it to be one of her objects in China to “assist the
Chinese Government in the work of reëstablishing
order so necessary in the primary interest of China
herself;”<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> at least, the pro-Russian Li Hung-chang
expressed, on June 22, an otherwise inexplicable
confidence in his ability to restore peace.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a> The real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>siege and firing of the Peking Legations had begun
two days before, on June 20, the day when Count
Muravieff uttered his optimistic remarks at St.
Petersburg. The latter died the next day, and was
succeeded in the Foreign Ministry by Count Lamsdorff.
On June 26, the Russian Government ordered
the mobilization into Manchuria of six large corps
of troops from Hailar, Blagovestchensk and Habarofsk,
Vladivostok and Possiet, and European Russia.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a>
One estimate put the number of the Russian
soldiers who had arrived in Manchuria by August
at 30,000.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a> It is not easy to determine whether
Russia took the offensive in the great Manchurian
campaign which now began, or whether hostile
acts of the Chinese precipitated it, but it seems
safe to say that rumors of impending dangers had
been abundant before the Russian troops poured
into the territory,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a> and also that the dispatch of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>latter apparently provoked more extensive outrages
of the rioters than would otherwise have been the
case. We hear of the destruction of the railway
and burning of religious establishments near Liao-yang
and Mukden only from the end of June and
beginning of July,<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a> and the alleged determination
of the Chinese troops to drive out all Russians
from Manchuria was reported in the Russian <cite>Official
Messenger</cite> toward the middle of July.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Just
at this time riots occurred in the Liao-tung and its
vicinity, communication by the Amur ceased, and
Blagovestchensk was suddenly bombarded by the
Chinese, followed by the slaughter of thousands
of Chinese inhabitants by the Russian soldiers
under General Gribsky.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Toward the south and
east, the depot of Ninguta was destroyed, and several
Russians were murdered at An-tung, about
July 20. The Russian troops, many of whom had
now arrived at different points in Manchuria, captured
Hun-chun on July 27, Argun on July 30,
Haibin on August 3, and Aigun and San-sin soon
afterward.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a> Even the treaty port of Niu-chwang
had also been seized, for which conduct the British
and American consular agents could not find
sufficient justification. On August 5, the port was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>placed under the civil administration of Russian
authorities, under which injustice and disorder were
said to have much increased.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a> It was on August
14, the day when the allied forces had almost
reached Peking, that General Groderkoff in command
of the northern army of the Manchurian
invasion wrote to the Minister of War at St. Petersburg:
“Fifty years ago Nevelskoy raised the Russian
flag at the mouth of the Amur, on its right
bank, and laid the foundation for our possessions
on that great river. Now, after hard fighting, we
have taken possession of the right bank, thus consolidating
the great enterprise of annexing the
whole of the Amur to Russia’s dominions, and
making that river an internal waterway and not a
frontier stream, whereby free and unmolested navigation
of that artery through one of the vastest
regions of the Empire has been secured.” Indeed,
by the time when the Peking Legations were relieved,
the major part of Manchuria had been
reduced under a military occupation by Russia.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
This may be said to mark a new stage in the development
of the Manchurian question, for no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>longer was this vast territory a mere sphere of Russian
influence; it was a prize of conquest.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a> The
problem for the Government of the Czar henceforth
seemed to the outside world to be not so
much how it might tighten its hold upon Manchuria,
as how it might convert the temporary occupation
into a permanent possession.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>NORTH CHINA AND MANCHURIA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The problem stated at the close of the last chapter
forms an index to a period of Eastern diplomacy
the singular features of which hardly find a
parallel in the world’s history. The affairs of the
Extreme Orient had in general advanced to such a
stage that no single Power could again seek to
enforce its will without due regard to the interests
of some other Powers. The Russian problem in
Manchuria was, as will be seen after a little reflection,
of such a nature that it could hardly be literally
propounded before the world. The absorption
of a vast and rich territory in China by a
Power whose policy was known to be aggressive
would at once arouse a determined protest of the
Powers which were, from interest and from conviction,
committed to the principles of the integrity
of the Chinese Empire and the open door therein
as the best means of insuring a lasting peace in the
Far East. The Manchurian question had to be developed
under a disguise until it would be, if ever,
safe to cast aside the veil. Hence began Russia’s
long, laborious effort to explain to the critical world
certain crude facts and deeds in Manchuria in the
terms of some refined foreign phrases—phrases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>whose significance in this particular case her rivals
well knew, but which they could not repudiate so long
as they themselves upheld the principles indicated by
those phrases. However, the moment a complex diplomatic
machinery relies upon subterfuges for its
success, its ingenuity will be taxed to the utmost,
or its unity will be in danger. For it will not be
easy to make the entire body of diplomatic agents
speak the same untruths at all places and at all
times. As soon as one pretext is uncovered, another
must be invented, as it were, on the spur of the
moment, in order to cover the retreat from the
last one—a necessary change which might render
a quick readjustment of the entire organism to the
newly created situation almost impossible. It would
indeed have been one of the most striking feats of
the government of a nation, if the artful diplomacy
of Russia had been able to combat successfully to
the end, with the enemy’s weapon, the straightforward
statecraft of the partisans of fair play.
Let us now observe in the remaining chapters of
this work how this process went on, and how it
finally defeated itself,—how ingenuity gave place
to threats, and how diplomacy ended in war.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has been suggested, Russia avowed that a
point in her policy in China at the outbreak of the
Boxer trouble was to assist the friendly Government
of that Empire in suppressing the insurrection and
restoring the normal order.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> When, however, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>spite of Count Muravieff’s inclination to regard this
matter lightly, all the Powers concerned deemed the
situation grave enough to justify sending forces to
the rescue of their Representatives and subjects in
Peking, it became necessary for Russia to act in
concert with the others, instead of alone assisting
China. Russia promptly, on June 16,<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a> declared her
intention to coöperate with the other Powers, and
claimed, about a month later, to have proposed to
the Powers the following “fundamental principles
as their rule of conduct in relation to events in
China,” which principles were agreed to by the majority
of the Powers:<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a> (1) Harmony among the Powers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>(2) the preservation of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> in China prior
to the trouble; (3) the elimination of everything
which might conduce to a partition of China; and
(4) the reëstablishment by common action of the
legitimate central Government at Peking, which
would be able of itself to guarantee order and tranquillity
in that country.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a> Probably before these propositions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>were penned by Count Muravieff, orders
had been issued by Russia to mobilize large forces
into Manchuria. In this territory and in North
China, events progressed rapidly in the next few
weeks, and, by the middle of August, the Legations
had been relieved, and the three Eastern Provinces
had largely fallen into the hands of the Russians.
It is essential to bear in mind this dual state of affairs,
for henceforth it appeared that the best efforts
of Russian diplomacy were made at once, in one
sense, in reconciling to one another, and, in another
sense, in insisting upon, the widely different situations
of Manchuria and of North China. On the one
hand, the principle of the integrity of China applied
to both regions alike, but, on the other, Russia
steadily declined to admit that Manchuria was within
the sphere of the concerted action of the Powers.
Thus, in her famous circular of August 25,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a> she declared,
in regard to Manchuria, where “temporary
measures” of military occupation “had been solely
dictated by the absolute necessity of repelling the
aggression of the Chinese rebels, and not with interested
motives, which are absolutely foreign to the
policy of the Imperial Government,” that, as soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>peace was restored and the security of the railway
was assured, “Russia would not fail to withdraw her
troops from the Chinese territory, provided such action
did not meet with obstacles caused by the proceedings
of other Powers.”<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> From these words it
was evident that Russia would not allow the Manchurian
question to be discussed by the Powers, for
she would withdraw from it, as she had occupied it,
on her own initiative, and with no interference from
others. More important still was the fact that Russia,
from this time on, pledged to evacuate Manchuria
under the apparently reasonable conditions—of
the question of the fulfillment of which, however,
Russia would be the sole judge—that peace and
security was restored in the territory, and that other
Powers did not interfere with her intentions. As
regards North China, the circular bespoke a striking
action on the part of Russia. Of the two original
intentions of Russia, namely, the rescue of the Russian
subjects in Peking and the assistance to China
to restore peace, the first had now been accomplished,
but the second was hindered by the absence of the
Imperial Court from the capital. In these circumstances,
Russia, seeing no reason for maintaining
the Legations and allied forces in Peking, would
now withdraw M. de Giers and the Russian troops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to Tientsin. It was explained later<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a> that, while the
action of Russia was not a technical proposition to
the other Powers, their concurrence in these measures
would conduce to the return of the Court to
the capital and facilitate the settlement of the affair
between the allies and China. It is interesting to
see that at the same time the Chinese Representative
at St. Petersburg urgently begged Li Hung-chang
to memorialize the Throne to the effect that an edict
should be issued to show China’s severity and ability
to maintain order when the European troops were
withdrawn, and the intention of the Court to return
shortly. The adoption of this course, it was thought,
would allay the apprehensions of the allies regarding
the withdrawal of their troops from Peking.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>The Russian declaration, so far as it regarded North
China, in spite of her avowal that she would act
strictly in concert with the other Powers, was as
surprising to some of the latter as it must have been
pleasing to China.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a> As might be expected, the
Powers, except France, doubted the practicability
of so early an evacuation of Peking.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a> A similar proposition
by Russia, dated September 17, so far as
the withdrawal of the Legations to Tientsin was concerned,
came to the same result.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Russia, on her
part, actually withdrew her troops to Tientsin, but
when peace negotiations were opened at Peking in
October, her Minister was obliged to be present
there. In the mean time, the different status in which
Russia held Manchuria from North China was made
evident by the vigorous prosecution of the campaign
in the former. Ninguta, Kirin, and Tsitsihar fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>into the Russian hands about the same time as the
evacuation of Peking was announced; Liao-yang
was taken late in September, and Mukden and Tieh-ling
early in October. Fêng-hwang-Chêng and An-tung
were captured even so late as December. On
September 7, a solemn thanksgiving was held at the
site of the burned town Sakhalien on the right bank
of the Amur across Blagovestchensk, in which
General Gribsky delivered a speech, and the high
priest Konoploff was reported to have said: “Now
is the cross raised on that bank of the Amur which
yesterday was Chinese. Muravieff foretold that
sooner or later this bank would be ours.”<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE ANGLO-GERMAN AGREEMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When we recall that even before 1900 Russia desired
to control the railway enterprises, not only in
Manchuria, but also on the right side of the Liao
River, it is not altogether strange that, simultaneously
with the occupation of Manchuria, the northern
Chinese line was seized by her troops. This action,
however, did not stop at the Great Wall. Had it
not been for the protest of Great Britain, the Russians
would have seized the entire line from Niu-chwang
up to Peking. During the latter part of
June, they captured the Tientsin depot, burned
the office, destroyed the safe and the documents it
contained, and seized land, some tracts of which
had been owned by British subjects.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a> On July 8,
the Northern Railway was seized and the British
engineer, C. W. Kinder, and his staff were turned
out,<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a> and, in spite of the dissent of the British and
American commanders, the Admirals of the allied
Powers voted on July 16 that the Russians should
manage the railway.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> In August, the Russians
claimed also the line between Tong-ku and Shanhai-Kwan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>on the one hand, and the one between
Tientsin and Peking, on the other, thus completing
the control of the entire connection.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a> British
protests were in a measure waived by the new
Commander-in-Chief of the allied forces, Count
von Waldersee, who early in October assigned the
repair of the section up to Yang-tsun to the Russians.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
About this time, fifty miles of railway
material belonging to a British firm were seized at
Niu-chwang by the Russians,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a> followed by the seizure
of the collieries at Tong-shan and Lin-si hitherto
operated by the Chinese Engineering and Mining
Company.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> Other incidents followed, greatly to the
annoyance of those whose interests had been invested
in the works. It was at this juncture that,
on October 16, 1900, an Agreement was signed
between the Governments of Great Britain and
Germany, upholding the principle of the open door
in China (Article 1), disclaiming territorial designs
upon China on the part of the contracting Powers
(Article 2), and supplemented by the following
(Article 3), embodying the well-known principle of
the balance of power at China’s expense: “In case of
another Power making use of the complications in
China in order to obtain under any form whatever
such territorial advantages, the two contracting
parties reserve to themselves the right to come to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>preliminary understanding as to the eventual steps
to be taken for the protection of their own interests
in China.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a> This is the notorious Anglo-German
Agreement, the fate of which has been an object
of much ridicule among writers upon Chinese
affairs of recent years. The diplomacy which had
resulted in the conclusion of this Agreement has not
been made known to the public, but as to the circumstances
which had caused the two Powers to
negotiate, it may safely be inferred that; so far as
the British side was concerned, the Russian conduct
in North China was a potent factor.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> As to the
deeper causes on both sides for the extraordinary
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rapprochement</span></i>, it is easy to speculate upon but
unsafe to asseverate them.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> The Agreement further
stated that other interested Powers should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>be invited to accept the principles recorded in it
(Article 4). It is interesting to see how this peculiar
combination of the principles of (1) the open
door, (2) the integrity of China, and (3) a balance
between the Powers on the Chinese ground,
was viewed by the other Powers. Japan joined the
Agreement on October 29, as a signatory, but not
as an adhering State.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> France, Austria, and Italy
recognized as identical with their own all of the
principles proposed,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> while the United States did
likewise with the first two, but expressed itself unconcerned
with the third.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a> As for Russia, she seized
this opportunity to indulge her diplomatic sarcasm.
She declared that, from her point of view, the
Agreement “did not perceptibly modify the situation
in China,” and the second principle perfectly
corresponded with Russia’s intentions, as “she was
the first to lay down the maintenance of the integrity
of the Chinese Empire as a fundamental principle
of her policy in China.” Her reply to the
first principle was delicately expressed, as follows:
It “can be favorably entertained by Russia, as this
stipulation does not infringe in any way the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status
quo</span></i> established in China <em>by existing treaties</em>.”<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> In
other words, the open door may or may not apply
to other places not yet covered by the existing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>treaties and still open to whatever development
might take place. The evil genius of the third
Article of the Anglo-German Agreement was not less
skillfully answered by Russia: “The Imperial Government,
while referring to its Circular of the 12th
(25th) August, can only renew the declaration that
such an infringement [by another Power] would
oblige Russia to modify her attitude according to
circumstances.”<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a> From these words, it was plain
that outside of the two contracting Powers, the
Agreement could not exercise great influence, and
least upon Russia, which declined to observe any
new feature in the instrument. The virtue of the
Agreement was, moreover, seriously impaired by the
insincerity of one of its parties, and by the consequent
difference of views between themselves. The
document was openly talked about in Germany as
the Yang-tsze Agreement, it being meant that Great
Britain thereby pledged herself to abstain from annexing
the Yang-tsze Provinces, hitherto considered,
much to the jealousy of Germany, as a British
sphere of interest.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a> More momentous was the question
whether the Agreement included in its scope,
not only the eighteen Provinces, but also Manchuria.
The answer would, of course, depend upon whether
both parties would consider, under the provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of the third Article, that they alike possessed “their
own interests” to protect in Manchuria. Seen in
this light, it is not strange that, in the opinion of
Lord Lansdowne, the “Agreement most unquestionably
extended to Manchuria, which is part of the
Chinese Empire,”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> while, from Count von Bülow’s
point of view, “The Anglo-German Agreement
had no reference to Manchuria.” “I can imagine
nothing,” he added, “which we can regard with
more indifference” than Manchuria.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Evidently
Germany had entered into the Agreement with different
motives from those of Great Britain, and
perhaps also with less zeal, if zeal there was.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In the mean time, the Chinese Court<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a> having largely
emancipated itself from the sway of the reactionary
Prince Tuan and his associates, the Representatives
at Peking of the eleven interested Powers had agreed
in September to open discussions among themselves
of the terms of peace to be presented to the Chinese
plenipotentiaries, Prince Ching and Li Hung-chang.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a>
The German Government, however, proposed,
as a prerequisite of peace negotiations with
China, a drastic measure demanding the surrender
to the Powers of the chief culprits of the recent
trouble. The proposition meeting little encouragement
from other Ministers, Germany presented a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>new condition on October 3. The latter was, however,
supplanted by the basis for negotiations formulated
on September 30 and presented five days
later to the Powers by the French Minister.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a> His
proposals, to which Russia immediately assented,<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a>
and which with important amendments<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a> and additions
became the basis of the Protocol signed on
September 7, 1901, comprised the following six
points: (1) the punishment of the chief offenders
designated by the Representatives of the Powers at
Peking; (2) maintenance of the prohibition of the
importation of arms into China; (3) indemnities for
the foreign governments, societies, and individuals;
(4) establishment of a permanent legation guard at
Peking; (5) dismantlement of the Taku forts; and
(6) military occupation of two or three points on
the road from Tientsin to Taku, so as to keep open
the passage between Peking and the sea. It is
needless for us to follow the negotiations which
proceeded at Peking after these proposals were
made by France, but it is important to observe that
the French propositions were limited, in the first
place, to North China, and, in the second place, to
those questions in North China which concerned all
the Powers alike. The significance of all this, or at
least of the prompt assent of Russia,<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a> may well be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>inferred from the opposition as readily offered by
the latter when Germany<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> and Japan,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a> respectively,
urged that a proper mention should be made in the
peace protocol of China’s consent to repair the
murder of Baron von Ketteler and the Chancellor
Sugiyama. Russia maintained that “proposals of
this nature, serving principally as a satisfaction to
be given to private views of one State, ought not to
enter into the common programme of the collective
demands, which had as their object the interests of
all the Powers collectively and the reëstablishment
of a normal state of affairs in the Celestial Empire.”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
“In the Chinese question it is advisable,” said the
<cite>Official Messenger</cite> of St. Petersburg, “not to lose
sight of the necessity of distinguishing clearly the
questions which interest each of the Powers in particular
and those which affect the interests of all the
Powers in general.”<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a> This distinction had been fundamental
in the Russian diplomacy in China since
1900, for, if one question of the former class was
allowed to be dealt with in the common deliberation
of the Representatives of all the Powers, why should
not another question of the same class be similarly
treated? Or, in other words, if the Sugiyama affair
was referred to the collective council, the argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>that the Manchurian problem should be
solved solely by Russia, without intervention of the
other Powers, would lose much of its force.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> The
ultimate failure of Russian diplomacy—for diplomacy
has failed when it ends in a war, and, if Russia
does succeed, her success will be that of force,
not of diplomacy—may be said to be largely due
to the evident contradiction of this fundamental
distinction between North China and Manchuria,
upon which she sought to build her entire diplomatic
structure in this crisis. As a matter of fact,
it was as impossible to deny the profound interest
felt by Great Britain and the United States, and,
above all, by Japan, in the economic development
of Manchuria, as it would have been to exclude
Russia from the community of the Powers in North
China. It should be remembered that Russia herself
persistently maintained that the principle of
the integrity of China applied also to Manchuria,
and she would have hardly antagonized other Powers
had she expressed an equally clear adhesion to the
principle of the open door, and made efforts to
carry out pledges regarding both principles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Events soon took place, however, which made
other Powers skeptical of Russia’s sincerity in her
profession of even the principle of the integrity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>the Chinese Empire. The new question thus thrust
upon the attention of the Powers was of an extremely
grave nature, for if the sovereignty of
Manchuria should eventually pass into the hands
of Russia, the treaty rights that other nations had
acquired therein from China might rightfully be
terminated by Russia. Whatever her ultimate objects,
it was hardly politic for her to approach the
difficult Manchurian question at the time and in
the manner selected by her. Dr. George Morrison
reported to the <cite>Times</cite> on December 31, 1900,
and Sir Ernest Satow, the British Minister at
Peking, confirmed it as authentic,<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a> that the delegates
of Admiral Alexieff and the Tartar General
Tsêng-chi, of Mukden, had signed, in November
last, an agreement whereby Russia consented to
return to the Chinese the civil government of the
Southern Province of Fêng-tien (Sheng-king) in
Manchuria, on the following conditions:—</p>

<p class='c032'>1. “The Tartar General Tsêng undertakes to protect
the province and pacify it, and to assist in the construction
of the railroad.</p>

<p class='c032'>2. “He must treat kindly the Russians in military
occupation, protecting the railway and pacifying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>province, and provide them with lodging and provisions.</p>

<p class='c032'>3. “He must disarm and disband the Chinese soldiery,
delivering in their entirety to the Russian military officials
all munitions of war in the arsenals not already
occupied by the Russians.</p>

<p class='c032'>4. “All forts and defenses in Fêng-tien not occupied
by the Russians, and all powder magazines not required
by the Russians, must be dismantled in the presence of
Russian officials.</p>

<p class='c032'>5. “Niu-chwang and other places now occupied by
the Russians shall be restored to the Chinese civil administration
when the Russian Government is satisfied
that the pacification of the provinces is complete.</p>

<p class='c032'>6. “The Chinese shall maintain law and order by local
police under the Tartar General.</p>

<p class='c032'>7. “A Russian Political Resident, with general powers
of control, shall be stationed at Mukden, to whom the
Tartar General must give all information respecting any
important measure.</p>

<p class='c032'>8. “Should the local police be insufficient in any emergency,
the Tartar General will communicate with the
Russian Resident at Mukden, and invite Russia to dispatch
reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c032'>9. “The Russian text shall be the standard.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In brief, the province was to be disarmed, its
military government to be in the Russian hands,
its civil government to be placed under the supervision
of a Russian Resident, with additional duties
on the part of the Chinese to provide for the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>military and to protect Russian properties.
The last provisions were coupled with the right
of the Russians to supply reinforcements, if the
Chinese local police should prove insufficient. The
probable significance of this measure will be fully
discussed in connection with the Russo-Chinese Convention
of April 8, 1902. As regards the Agreement
now under discussion, Dr. Morrison opined
that it would necessarily be followed by similar
agreements with reference to the other two of the
three Eastern Provinces,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a> and then all Manchuria
would be “a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> Russian protectorate, Russia
by a preëxisting agreement having already the
right to maintain all necessary troops for the protection
of the railway.” It is needless to say that
the report of this Agreement caused universal
amazement in the diplomatic world. It soon became
known<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> that the Chinese delegate who signed
it at Port Arthur had received no authorization to
do so from the Peking Government.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a> But the Japanese
Government, hearing from a reliable source
that so late as the beginning of February, Russia
was pressing China to ratify the Agreement, undertook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>to express its opinion to the Chinese Minister
at Tokio, that the conclusion of any such
agreement would be a “source of danger” to the
Chinese Government, and that no arrangement
affecting territorial rights of the Empire ought to
be concluded between the Chinese Government and
any one of the Powers.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a> At the instance of Japan,
Great Britain also made precisely the same representation
to China,<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a> Germany following the example
in slightly different language,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c014'><sup>[336]</sup></a> and the
United States also reminding China of “the impropriety,
inexpediency, and even extreme danger to
the interests of China, of considering any private
territorial and financial engagements, at least without
the full knowledge and approval of all the
Powers now engaged in negotiation.”<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c014'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It has often been reported in the press that the
Agreement was never ratified by either China or
Russia. Before, however, any of the protests of the
Powers reached the Peking Government, Count
Lamsdorff had, on February 6, “very readily” explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the situation to the British Ambassador at St.
Petersburg. He said it was quite untrue that any
agreement which would give Russia new rights and
a virtual protectorate in Southern Manchuria had
been concluded or was under discussion with China,
but “the Russian military authorities who had been
engaged in the temporary occupation and pacification
of that province had been directed, when reinstating
the Chinese authorities in their former posts,
to arrange with the local civil authorities a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus
vivendi</span></i> for the duration of the simultaneous presence
of Russian and Chinese authorities in Southern
Manchuria, the object being to prevent the recurrence
of disturbances in the vicinity of the Russian
frontier, and to protect the railway from the Russian
frontier to Port Arthur.” “Some of the details of
the proposed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</span></i> had been sent for consideration
to St. Petersburg, but no convention or
arrangement with the central Government of China
or of a permanent character had been concluded
with regard to Manchuria, nor had the Emperor any
intention of departing in any way from the assurances
which he had publicly given that Manchuria
would be entirely restored to its former condition in
the Chinese Empire as soon as circumstances admitted
of it.”<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a> A careful reading of this statement,
as typical of the many declarations made by Russia
in regard to Manchuria, will show how untenable
is the popular view that she persistently falsifies.
There is here a fair admission that a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>was under way between the Russian military officers
in Southern Manchuria and the local Chinese authorities,
and that it was not of a permanent nature,
nor was it concluded with the central Government
at Peking, and both of these points accord with the
reported facts. Nor can one deny the cogency of
the argument that Russia would evacuate Manchuria
“as soon as circumstances admitted of it.” What
constituted the objectionable feature of the affair,
from the standpoint of the interested Powers, must
have been that, inasmuch as Count Lamsdorff would
not publish the terms of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</span></i>, it was
not possible for them to satisfy themselves that it
contained nothing which would render impossible
the consummation of “circumstances” favorable for
evacuation, and eventually tend toward a “permanent”
possession of the territory by Russia. As
matters stood, it would be as natural for the Powers
to entertain such a doubt, as it was for Russia to
deem it necessary to declare, in her circular of
August 25, 1900, that she would withdraw from
Manchuria if, for one thing, no obstacle was placed
in her way by the action of other Powers. The
doubt of the Powers was rather intensified, if at all,
by the further explanation by Count Lamsdorff on
February 6, that “when it came to the final and
complete evacuation of Manchuria, the Russian
Government would be obliged to obtain from the
central Government of China an effective guarantee
against the recurrence of the recent attack on her
frontier and the destruction of her railway, but had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>no intention of seeking this guarantee in any acquisition
of territory or of an actual or virtual
protectorate over Manchuria, the object being to
simply guarantee the faithful observance in the
future by China of the terms of the agreement
[agreement between the Chinese Government and
the Russo-Chinese Bank, September 28, 1896?],
which she had been unable to fulfill during the
disturbances. The terms of this guarantee might
possibly form the subject of conversation here between
Count Lamsdorff and the Chinese Minister,
or be left for discussion at Peking.”<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a> A month
before this official statement of Russia reached the
London Government, the latter heard from the
Japanese Minister, Baron Hayashi, that Russia and
China had already made at St. Petersburg some
arrangement regarding Manchuria,<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a> evidently referred
to by Count Lamsdorff in the quoted passage
as “an effective guarantee.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was as early as January 12 that the Japanese
Government had made inquiries directly at the
Russian Government regarding the contents of the
Agreement reported to have been made between
Count Lamsdorff and Yang-yu at St. Petersburg.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a>
The report was apparently premature, for its
contents were unknown for more than a month
after, and even on February 18, Dr. Morrison
reported from Peking that, according to a telegram
to the Chinese Government from Yang-yu,
it would be several days before Count Lamsdorff
and M. Witte could settle the terms between themselves
of the new agreement they wished to propose.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
The <cite>Times</cite> correspondent, however, was
able to send certain preliminary articles which,
he said, had been verbally communicated by M.
Witte to Yang-yu.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a> On February 27, Sir Ernest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Satow<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a> and Dr. Morrison<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c014'><sup>[345]</sup></a> simultaneously reported
the contents of the agreement which Yang-yu had
been called upon by Count Lamsdorff to sign, and
which he had telegraphed to Peking on the 23d.
The proposed convention was, according to Dr.
Morrison, obviously intended to exist side by side
with the Alexieff-Tsêng Agreement concluded in
the previous November. The substance of this convention,
the authenticity of which the same writer
claimed to have been admitted by the Russians
in Peking, was as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>1. “The Emperor of Russia, being desirous of manifesting
his friendship for China, ignores the outbreak of
hostilities in Manchuria, and agrees to restore the whole
of that country to China, to be administered in all respects
as of old.</p>

<p class='c032'>2. “By the 6th Article of the Manchurian Railway
Agreement, the Railway Company was authorized to
guard the line with troops. The country being at present
in disorder, the number of those troops is insufficient for
the purpose, and a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps</span></i> must be retained until order is
restored and China has executed the last four Articles of
the present convention.</p>

<p class='c032'>3. “In case of emergency the troops retained in Manchuria
shall render every possible assistance to China in
preserving order.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>4. “Chinese troops having been the greatest aggressors
in the recent attacks on Russia, China agrees not
to organize an army until the railway is completed and
opened to traffic. When military forces are organized
eventually, their numbers shall be fixed in consultation
with Russia. The importation of arms and munitions of
war into Manchuria is prohibited.</p>

<p class='c032'>5. “As a measure for the preservation of Manchuria,
China shall dismiss from office all Generals-in-Chief
(Tartar Generals) and high officials whose actions conflict
with friendly relations, and who are denounced for
that reason by Russia. China may organize mounted
and foot police in the interior of Manchuria, but their
numbers shall be fixed in consultation with Russia.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Cannon shall be excluded from their armament, and
no subjects of another Power shall be employed in the
execution of the functions.</p>

<p class='c032'>6. “In accordance with the understanding formerly
accepted by China, no subject of another Power shall be
employed to train naval or military forces in the Northern
Provinces (i. e., Provinces in North China).</p>

<p class='c032'>7. “The local authorities nearest to the neutral zone
referred to in Article 5 of the Liao-tung Agreement (of
March 15/27, 1898) shall make special regulations for
the preservation of order in the zone.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The administrative autonomy of Kin-chow shall be
abolished.</p>

<p class='c032'>8. “Without the consent of Russia, China shall not
concede mining, railway, or other privileges to another
Power, in the countries adjoining Russia, that is to
say, in Manchuria, Mongolia, Tarbagatai, Ili, Kashgar,
Yarkand, Khoten, etc. China shall not herself construct
a railway in those countries without Russia’s consent.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Outside of Niu-chwang, land shall not be leased to
the subjects of another Power.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>9. “China is under obligation to pay Russia’s war
expenses and indemnities to the Powers. The amount
of indemnity due to Russia, the dates of payment, and
the security, shall be arranged conjointly with the Powers.</p>

<p class='c032'>10. “The amounts due for damage done to the railway,
for the property of the Company’s employees which
was stolen, and for losses caused by delay of the works,
shall be arranged by the company with China.</p>

<p class='c032'>11. “An understanding may be come to with the Railway
Company to set off the whole or part of the above
indemnities against privileges of other kinds. This may
be arranged by an alteration of the existing Railway
Agreement (of August 27 / September 8, 1896), or by the
concession of further privileges.</p>

<p class='c032'>12. “China shall, as previously agreed,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c014'><sup>[346]</sup></a> grant a concession
for the construction of a railway from Manchurian
main line, or a branch line, to the Great Wall in the
direction of Peking.”<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c014'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There never appeared an authentic text of the
convention from either the Russian or the Chinese
official sources, but its existence in some drastic
form was intimated by the Viceroys Liu and
Chang, and by the Court Ministers then at Si-ngan,
as well as by the Chinese Emperor himself.<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c014'><sup>[348]</sup></a>
Furthermore, it could be plainly inferred that no
one but Chinese diplomatic officials could have let
out the terms of the proposed convention, or else
it would have been impossible for one to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>that an instrument of so immense a scope and so
arbitrary a nature, as had been reported, could
have emanated from Russia. If the reported text
was in the main authentic, as Sir Ernest Satow believed
it was,<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c014'><sup>[349]</sup></a> it is little wonder that Russia exercised
a vigorous pressure upon the Peking Government
for a speedy signing of the convention before
the arrival of effective protests from other Powers,
her Minister at Peking stating to Prince Ching and
Li Hung-chang that the Agreement concerned only
Russia and China, and that the Peking Government
should not take any notice of what the foreign Representatives
might say about it.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c014'><sup>[350]</sup></a> The Court appeared
seized by a panic, excepting the pro-Russian
Li Hung-chang, who pretended that he considered
that the proposed convention would not impair the
sovereignty of China in Manchuria.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c014'><sup>[351]</sup></a> The Emperor,
declaring that “it was impossible for China alone
to incur the displeasure of Russia by remaining
firm,” appealed, on February 28, to Great Britain,
the United States, Germany, and Japan to mediate.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c014'><sup>[352]</sup></a>
The British Government at once instructed Sir
Ernest Satow to stay the hand of Li, who was about
to sign, till he had received the replies of the four
Powers whose mediation had been formally requested
by the Emperor, and also to urge the patriotic
Yang-tsze Viceroys to memorialize the Throne
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>against the acceptance of the Russian proposition.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c014'><sup>[353]</sup></a>
The Viceroys, as well as several other subjects of
China, had already done so.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c014'><sup>[354]</sup></a> The British remonstrance
to China against entering into separate
agreements with individual Powers was repeated
on March 20.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c014'><sup>[355]</sup></a> At the same time Germany suggested,
Great Britain and Japan seconding, that
China should refer the matter to the conference of
the foreign Representatives at Peking, who were, it
should be remembered, in the midst of their difficult
discussion of the preliminary terms of peace
between the Powers and China.<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c014'><sup>[356]</sup></a> It is unnecessary
to say that Japan, in concert with Great Britain,
strongly urged the Chinese Government not to sign
the convention separately with one of the Powers,
for such an act was contrary to the principle of
solidarity which then united the Powers, and an
individual convention with a Power would materially
lessen the capacity of China to meet her obligations
toward all the Powers.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c014'><sup>[357]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At this point we have to record a singular conjunction
of circumstances which has caused criticisms
not altogether favorable to Russia. It has already
been shown that she had frequently had recourse
to acts which at once placed her somewhat apart
from the community of the Powers, and also were
liable to be interpreted as being designed to ingratiate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>herself with the afflicted China. Thus Count
Lamsdorff more than once deprecated the continuance
of the punitive expeditions which the allied
forces made to one place or another in the Province
of Chili.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c014'><sup>[358]</sup></a> His reasons were so apparently plausible
that, under different circumstances, he might have
been supported by certain other Powers.<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c014'><sup>[359]</sup></a> These
very Powers, however, most keenly resented Russia’s
detachment from the allies, when she definitely
cleared herself from the deliberation of the
Representatives of the Powers at Peking in regard
to the punishment to be inflicted by the Chinese
Government upon certain provincial officials who
had been directly guilty of outrages to foreigners
during the recent trouble. The peace commissioners
had almost disposed of the punishment question,
in order next to attack the knotty problem of the
indemnity to be paid by China, but M. de Giers
had been instructed by his Government “not only
to abstain from entering into any discussion as
to the nature or method of execution of the capital
sentence, but also to take no part in the further
discussions relative to the punishment to be
inflicted on the Chinese dignitaries.”<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c014'><sup>[360]</sup></a> “At the
meeting [of the peace commissioners at Peking]
to-day,” wrote Sir Ernest Satow on February 28,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the day after he reported the draft of the most
exhaustive agreement broached by Russia upon
China, and the very day when the Chinese Emperor
appealed to Great Britain, Germany, the
United States, and Japan to intervene, “we presented
to our colleagues our list of provincial officials,
of whom ten were named as deserving the
death penalty and about ninety to be punished in
a lesser degree. Objection was made only by the
Russian Minister, who stated that he could not accept
our proposals unless he received fresh instructions,
and that his Government’s wish from the
beginning had been to substitute a less severe form
of punishment for the death penalty. Both my
French colleague and I are of opinion that our
death penalty list might justly have included far
more than what had been demanded, and is exceedingly
moderate in its reduced form.”<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c014'><sup>[361]</sup></a> On March
15, that is, about the time when the terms of her
proposed agreement were, as will be presently seen,
modified by Russia in China’s favor, Sir Charles
Scott wrote Lord Salisbury that recently Count
Lamsdorff had intimated that “he considered the
question of the punishment of Chinese officials
at an end as far as concerned Russia,” and that
“he referred to the murders of the missionaries
as a subject in which Russia was not interested.”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c014'><sup>[362]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Such a remark was regarded as a radical departure
from the diplomatic amenities between the Powers.
Russia might without offense have pleaded her
reasons against the opinion of the majority, and
then dissented at the final vote, but it was considered
a very different matter for her to declare, in
such a way as would openly place the other Powers
in a false light in the eyes of the Chinese, that she
had nothing to do with the question. The act, it
must be said, came with particular ill grace at a
time when Russia was believed to be negotiating
an agreement with China, separately, and in terms
manifestly contrary to the fundamental principles
upon which the Powers’ diplomacy at Peking was
based.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c014'><sup>[363]</sup></a> A joint vote demanding the punishment
of the officials had to be presented to the Chinese
commissioners, on April 1, with the signatures of
all but M. de Giers.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c014'><sup>[364]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Directly in connection with this episode may be
considered the fact that, at the urgent request of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>China, Russia had in the mean time somewhat modified
the terms of her proposition, about March
19, so as, in brief, to allow China to station troops
in Manchuria for the protection of the Russian railways
and the prevention of fresh disorders, their
numbers and posts to be determined by consulting
Russia; and also to prohibit the importation of
arms and ammunition only in accordance with the
agreement with the Powers (Article 4); to exclude
cannon from the armament of the Chinese mounted
and foot police forces in Manchuria only until peace
is restored (Article 5); to retain the administrative
autonomy of Kin-chow (Article 7); and to arrange
with the Company the matter of indemnities in accordance
with the general method used by the Powers
(Article 10). The eighth Article was altered so as to
apply the exclusive measure only to Manchuria, and
the sixth was entirely expunged.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c014'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Simultaneously
with these modifications in China’s favor, Russia
seemed to have suddenly increased her pressure upon
the helpless Court of China. Count Lamsdorff was reported<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c014'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
to have declared to Yang-yu that he would
withdraw the draft and break off negotiations if it
were not signed within two weeks from March 13.
An Imperial Decree, dated March 20, and addressed
to Sir Chin-chen Lo-fêng-luh, the Chinese Minister at
London, stated: “The Manchurian Agreement has
now been amended, but the stipulated time within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>which the Agreement is to be signed will soon expire.
As the Marquess of Lansdowne has advised us
to wait for his reply [to the Edict of February 28],
we have now to command Lo-fêng-luh to ask Lord
Lansdowne either (1) to help us out of the difficulty,
or (2) to ask Russia to extend the time stipulated
for signing the Agreement. Otherwise, we, being
placed in great difficulty, will be unable to oppose
Russia any further. An immediate reply is expected.
Respect this.”<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c014'><sup>[367]</sup></a> On the next day came an urgent
appeal from Yang-tsze Viceroys and Taotai Sheng,
who requested, under instructions from the Chinese
Government, that Great Britain, the United States,
Germany, and Japan intervene to obtain an extension
of time with a view to the modification of the
Articles regarding civil administration in the Chinese
garrisons in Manchuria, the exclusive trading
rights demanded by the Russians, and the proposed
railway to the Wall.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c014'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Six days later, on March 27,
the two-week period expired, and the Chinese Court,
which still sojourned at Si-ngan in the Shen-si
Province, telegraphed to Sir Chin-chen Lo-fêng-luh,
as follows: “We have followed the advice of Lord
Lansdowne, in not giving our authority to sign the
Manchurian Agreement. In your telegrams of the
20th<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c014'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and 23d<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c014'><sup>[370]</sup></a> instant, you have assured us of
the moral support of England if we followed her
advice. Our Plenipotentiaries, Prince Ching and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>Viceroy Li, report that Russia will now permanently
occupy Manchuria, and that the collective negotiations
will have to be suspended. The Court feels
great anxiety about this matter. As Manchuria is
the cradle of the present dynasty, how could China
tolerate a permanent occupation of that region? We
now apply for the positive assistance of England in
bringing about a satisfactory settlement between
China and Russia, in order to avoid a rupture with
that Power, which could not fail to be detrimental
to the interests of China and the treaty Powers.
Please lay the contents of the telegram before Lord
Lansdowne and request an immediate reply.”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c014'><sup>[371]</sup></a> It
is possible that these messages were simultaneously
repeated to some or all of the rest of the four
Powers, and, if so, it becomes tenable that, but for
the protests of the Powers, Li Hung-chang might
have signed the agreement. Nor can it be denied
that, even after their final refusal to accept the
Russian proposals, the Chinese officials clearly apprehended
that, failing the positive support of the
Powers, Manchuria would be <em>permanently</em> occupied
by the northern Power. It is, of course, uncertain,
and perhaps also immaterial, whether they had voluntarily
reached that conclusion, or whether the
Russians had led them to the belief by threats.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us now turn to see what explanations Russia
had offered, for Japan about January 12<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c014'><sup>[372]</sup></a> and
Great Britain on March 4<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c014'><sup>[373]</sup></a> had made inquiries at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the Russian Government in respect to the actual
text of the Agreement. Lord Lansdowne repeated
his query on March 9, adding that if the version
reported by Sir Ernest Satow was approximately
accurate, it was “impossible to describe it as a
contract of a temporary and provisional nature,
and our treaty rights were certainly affected by it.”
Then, in his oft outspoken vein, the Marquess concluded:
“On the other hand, it is surely reasonable
that we should ask his Excellency’s [Count Lamsdorff’s]
help in exposing the trick, and putting the
saddle on the right horse, if, as he suggests, garbled
versions of the Agreement are being circulated by
the Chinese Government in order to create dissension
between the Powers; and you may state that
to join the Russian Government in exhibiting in its
true light so discreditable a manœuvre would afford
the liveliest satisfaction to His Majesty’s Government.”<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c014'><sup>[374]</sup></a>
Russia, however, would not communicate
the text of the proposed Agreement, and it was
explained later by Count Lamsdorff that there had
been a “programme,” the detail of which had at
one time or another been under discussion, but
there had never existed any regular draft Agreement
in twelve Articles; that the Czar had at
no time given him the full powers indispensable
for concluding such an agreement, and that in
her negotiations with China [concerning the programme],
three different Departments of the Russian
Government had been equally engaged. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>circumstances, and also “the unwise interference
of the press and public, which seemed to assert a
very dangerous claim to be admitted to a seat and
voice in the councils of the Powers regarding
China,” made it very difficult for the Count to be as
frankly communicative as he would otherwise have
wished to have been. Indeed, “it would have been
impossible for him to have discussed the details of
these negotiations with a third Government.”<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c014'><sup>[375]</sup></a> To
the Japanese Minister, who had been instructed by
his Government to make the friendly proposal to
Russia that the Representatives of the Powers at
Peking should be given an opportunity to consider
the draft of the Manchurian Agreement before it
was signed, Count Lamsdorff replied in no less interesting
manner. He observed, on March 26, that
the Agreement solely concerned two independent
States, and must be concluded without the intervention
of any other Powers, and politely but firmly
declined to consider any such proposal as was made
by Japan. The Count added, however, that “he
could give an official assurance to the Japanese
Minister that neither the sovereignty and the integrity
of China in Manchuria nor the treaty rights
of any other Power were affected by the proposed
Agreement; that it was of a provisional nature,
and a necessary preliminary to the Russian troops
evacuating the province. Its early signature was
desired by his Excellency in order that the unjust
suspicions aroused by false reports with regard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>it might be removed by its publication.”<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c014'><sup>[376]</sup></a> Satisfied
neither with this statement nor with China’s
refusal to sign the Agreement, the Japanese Government
is said to have made a second protest at
St. Petersburg in a more resolute tone than in
the first, on April 5.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c014'><sup>[377]</sup></a> On the same day, however,
appeared in the Russian <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Officiel</span></cite> a long
statement recapitulating Russia’s relations with
China since the beginning of the Boxer affair, and
declaring that, owing to the publication in the
foreign press of all sorts of false reports of the
alleged treaties with China, and to the serious obstacles
that had apparently been put in the way of
China as regards the conclusion of an agreement
with Russia serving as “a starting-point” toward
the restoration of Manchuria to China, “it had
been found impossible immediately to take the
measures contemplated for the gradual evacuation
of Manchuria.” The negotiations had been dropped.
“With regard to the question of the complete and
final restitution of this territory to China,” concluded
the official statement, “it is evident that it
can only be accomplished after a normal state of
affairs has been reëstablished in the Chinese Empire,
and a central Government has been secured
in the capital, independent and sufficiently strong
to guarantee Russia against the renewal of the disturbances
of last year. While maintaining the
present temporary form of government with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>object of insuring order in the neighborhood of
the vast Russian frontier, but remaining unalterably
true to their original programme, as repeatedly
formulated, the Imperial Government will quietly
await the future progress of events.”<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c014'><sup>[378]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>FURTHER DEMANDS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Russia did not wait long before reaching another
“starting-point.” No sooner did the effort of Viceroy
Chang Chih-tung and the late Viceroy Liu
Kun-yi to create among the Representatives of some
Powers a sentiment in favor of opening all Manchuria
to foreign trade, so as to forestall the annexation
of the territory by Russia, miscarry,<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c014'><sup>[379]</sup></a> than Sir
Ernest Satow reported from “a thoroughly trustworthy
source,” on August 14, 1901, that Russia
was resuming her negotiations with China to bring
about the signature of the amended Manchurian
Agreement of the preceding March.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c014'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Lord Lansdowne
at once instructed him to inform the Chinese
authorities, if his advice was requested, that the
proper course for them to pursue would be to call
the attention of the Powers to the matter and to
communicate the text of the provisions in question,
should they prove inconsistent with the treaty obligations
of China to other Powers or with the integrity
of the Empire; so that the British Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>should be ready to advise whether an infraction of its
treaty rights was involved, or whether the provisions
were in any other way objectionable.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c014'><sup>[381]</sup></a> It does
not appear that Russia exercised great pressure
upon China for the conclusion of the Agreement.
Toward the end of the month, M. de Giers was replaced
as Russian Minister at Peking by M. Paul
Lessar, formerly a railway engineer on the Afghan
frontier, and a man of delicate health but brilliant
parts. Meanwhile, the peace commissioners of the
eleven Powers had at last, on September 17,
1901, succeeded in signing at Peking with the two
Chinese Plenipotentiaries the final Protocol between
China and the Powers for the resumption of their
friendly relations.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c014'><sup>[382]</sup></a> It seems that, when the affairs
in North China were thus finally settled, Russia
felt herself freer than she ever had been to deal independently
with China concerning the Manchurian
question, which the Powers had allowed to remain.
Moreover, the Imperial Court was expected shortly
to return to the capital, and the Chinese Government
began to look anxiously for the withdrawal of
foreign troops from the realm. Seizing this opportunity,
M. Lessar seems to have mooted, probably
on October 5,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c014'><sup>[383]</sup></a> a new convention of evacuation,
whose comparatively mild terms commended themselves
powerfully at this moment to the Chinese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>commissioners, especially to Li Hung-chang.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c014'><sup>[384]</sup></a> Considering
the feeble attitude of China, it would have
been extremely difficult for the interested Powers to
protest to her against the acceptance of the Russian
demands, had not the Viceroys Liu and Chang, after
learning their contents, again strongly reminded
the Emperor and the Empress Dowager of the
direct peril to the reigning dynasty which might
result from acceding to the Russian proposals. In
accordance with the wishes of the Court, the dying
Li Hung-chang is said to have, on his sick-bed,
seen M. Lessar, and appealed to the Russian friendship
toward China to modify the terms of the proposed
amendment.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c014'><sup>[385]</sup></a> Li soon passed away, on November
7, leaving the gravest problem of China in a
state of extreme uncertainty. As to the contents of
the Russian proposition, it is interesting to observe
that they were presently revealed from a source
whose veracity could hardly be questioned. On
December 11, Prince Ching disclosed them to Mr.
Conger.<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c014'><sup>[386]</sup></a> They coincided with those that the latter
had reported to Secretary Hay on the 3d, namely,
that, stated briefly, Russia should evacuate Manchuria,
under the usual conditions, in three years;
that China should protect the railways and Russian
subjects in the territory; that she might station,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>in places other than lands assigned to the Railway
Company, mounted and foot soldiers, whose numbers
should, however, be determined by an agreement
with Russia, and who should exclude artillery;
that troops of no other nationality should be employed
in protecting the railways; that the Anglo-Russian
Agreement of April, 1899, should be
strictly adhered to; that subjects of no other nationality
should without Russian consent be allowed to
build railways or bridges in Southern Manchuria;
and that the Shan-hai-kwan-Niu-chwang-Sinminting
Railways should be returned to China after her
payment to Russia of the expenditure incurred by
the latter in their occupation.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c014'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Prince Ching, it appears,
presented a counter-proposition to the Russian
convention, which, among other things, seems to
have requested that the evacuation of Manchuria
should be completed within one year, instead of three,
as was provided in the original draft. Russia’s reply
to this arrived in Peking the last of January, 1902,
agreeing to reduce the period of evacuation from
three to two years.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c014'><sup>[388]</sup></a> At the same time, however, the
Russian Government now strongly supported, in addition
to the proposed convention, a separate agreement
proposed by the Russo-Chinese Bank. The
latter, according to Prince Ching, contained, besides
the railway concessions already granted to the Bank,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>provision that China should herself undertake all
industrial development in Manchuria, but if she
required financial help from the outside, application
should always first be made to the Russo-Chinese
Bank; only when the latter did not wish to engage
in the work might citizens of other countries be
allowed to undertake it. A clause was also to be
inserted, the practical value of which is not clear,
that citizens of every country should have the same
rights as they then did to trade at the open ports
and in the interior.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c014'><sup>[389]</sup></a> Prince Ching was obliged to
acknowledge to Mr. Conger, on January 19, 1902,
that, owing to the pressure which Russia increased
simultaneously with the apparent concessions she
had made, she would yield no further, and “he was
convinced that, if China held out longer, they
would never again secure terms so lenient; that
the Russians were in full possession of the territory,
and their treatment of the Chinese was so aggravating
that longer occupation was intolerable; that
they must be got out, and that the only way left
for China to accomplish this was to make the best
possible terms. The only terms that Russia would
consent to were the signing of both the Convention
and the Russo-Chinese Bank Agreement.”<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c014'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to say that against the Russian
demands Great Britain, Japan, and the United
States had separately and more than once entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>firm protests at Peking. The conduct of the first
two Powers, however, is not shown in the published
documents. Secretary Hay reminded the Russian
and Chinese Governments, on February 3, of the
repeated assurances made by the Czar’s Foreign
Minister of his devotion to the principle of the
open door in all parts of China, and said: “An
agreement whereby China gives any corporation or
company the exclusive right or privilege of opening
mines, establishing railroads, or in any other
way industrially developing Manchuria, can but be
viewed with the greatest concern by the Government
of the United States. It constitutes a monopoly,
which is a distinct breach of the stipulations of
the treaties concluded between China and foreign
Powers, and thereby seriously affects the rights of
American citizens.”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c014'><sup>[391]</sup></a> To this note, the interesting
reply of Count Lamsdorff, signed by himself, was:
“... It [the Russian Government] feels itself
bound ... to declare that negotiations carried on
between two entirely independent States are not
subject to be submitted to the approval of other
Powers. There is no thought of attacking the principle
of the ‘open door’ <em>as that principle is understood
by the Imperial Government of Russia</em>,<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c014'><sup>[392]</sup></a> and
Russia has no intention whatever to change <em>the
policy followed by her in that respect up to the
present time</em>. If the Russo-Chinese Bank should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>obtain concessions in China, the agreements of a
private character relating to them would not differ
from those heretofore concluded by so many other
foreign corporations.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c014'><sup>[393]</sup></a> But would it not be very
strange if the ‘door’ that is ‘open’ to certain nations
should be closed to Russia, whose frontier adjoins
that of Manchuria, and who has been forced by
recent events to send her troops into that province
to reëstablish order in the plain and common interest
of all nations?... It is impossible to deny
to an independent State the right to grant to others
such concessions as it is free to dispose of, and I
have every reason to believe that the demands of
the Russo-Chinese Bank do not in the least exceed
those that have been so often formulated by other
foreign companies, and I feel that under the circumstances
it would not be easy for the Imperial
Government to deny to the Russian companies that
support which is given by other Governments to
companies and syndicates of their own nationalities.
At all events, I beg your Excellency to believe
that there is not, nor can there be, any question of
the contradiction of the assurances which, under the
orders of His Majesty the Emperor, I have had occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>to give heretofore in regard to the principles
which invariably direct the policy of Russia.”<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c014'><sup>[394]</sup></a> It
should be noted here that Count Lamsdorff’s statement,
while it refers to the Agreement with the Bank,
which he supported, contains no reference to the
Convention proposed by the Russian Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negotiations lagged, China probably declining
to sign under the remonstrances of Great Britain,
the United States, and Japan. On March 2, Prince
Ching showed Mr. Conger a draft of his new counter-proposals,
which Japan was said to have wholly,
and Great Britain in the main, approved.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c014'><sup>[395]</sup></a> These
proposals are interesting for their practical identity,
save a slight difference,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c014'><sup>[396]</sup></a> with the final Russo-Chinese
Convention of April 8, 1902, which will be
fully treated in a subsequent chapter. This fact is a
conclusive evidence that after March, Russia suddenly
accepted nearly all of the counter-proposals
made by China. This abrupt condescension on the
part of Russia is supposed to have been partly due
to an important event which had recently taken
place in the diplomatic world—the conclusion of
the Anglo-Japanese Agreement signed at London on
January 30, 1902, and simultaneously announced
in Parliament and the Imperial Diet of Tokio on
February 12.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The details of the negotiations preliminary to the
consummation of this remarkable stroke of diplomacy
have not been made public, but we are in
possession of some salient facts from which successive
steps leading up to the final conclusion may be
inferred with tolerable certainty. It is well known
that Great Britain, which had always occupied a
predominant place in the foreign relations of Japan,
had persistently opposed the latter’s ardent wish and
continual struggle to revise the humiliating treaties
which had, about 1858, been imposed by the Powers
upon the weak feudal Government of Yedo. In
1894, however, contrary to her past policy, Great
Britain led other Powers in according to Japan a
cordial recognition of the latter’s progress in various
lines of her national activity, and assenting to
the revision of her treaties. During the war with
China in 1894–5, the British attitude was one of
friendly neutrality between the two Oriental Empires,
but the events after the conclusion of the
war, especially the forced retrocession of the Liao-tung
Peninsula, closely followed by the tightening
hold of the Muscovites upon the Peking Court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>seemed to have aroused the sympathy of Great
Britain with Japan, mingled probably with the fear
of the loss of some of her own predominant economic
interests in China. From this time on, the
interests of the two Powers had been seen to coincide
in the Far East to an increasing degree, and
the relations of their Governments had steadily
risen in cordiality.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c014'><sup>[397]</sup></a> At the rupture of the Boxer
insurrection in 1900, the Cabinet of Lord Salisbury
manifested so much faith in Japan as to request
her immediately to dispatch large forces to the relief
of the besieged Legations at Peking, Great
Britain going even so far as to engage to undertake
the necessary financial responsibilities of the proposed
expedition.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c014'><sup>[398]</sup></a> Both during the campaign and
throughout the negotiation for peace, the two
Powers, as well as the United States, conducted
themselves together, as is apparent from our foregoing
discussion, in perfect harmony.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c014'><sup>[399]</sup></a> The common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>danger in Manchuria still further cemented their
friendship. All this cordial relation, spontaneous
as it was, would not, however, account for the formation
of a definite alliance between the two Governments.
It seems at least probable that the Anglo-German
Agreement of October, 1900, as much
by the importance of some of its principles as by
its very inefficiency, served as a natural step toward
a more wholesome alliance.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c014'><sup>[400]</sup></a> In this new direction,
Great Britain is said to have taken the initiative.
This supposition will appear not improbable when
it is considered that her immense interests in China,
which had begun to be eclipsed by other Powers,
would be best secured and promoted by the maintenance
of the integrity of China and the open door
in her market, and that this object could not be
better assured than by an alliance with the strongest
Eastern Power, whose fast growing interests in
the neighboring lands were in a large measure
identical with hers. Suggestions for such an agreement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>are known to have been made by Great Britain
to Japan under the Itō Cabinet in April, 1901,
and again under the present Katsura Cabinet in
July, but it was not till October of that year that
definite negotiations were opened by Japan. The
Premier, Viscount Katsura, seems to have ascertained
in December that the elder statesmen of the Empire
were in hearty accord with the agreement toward
which the negotiations had pointed.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c014'><sup>[401]</sup></a> At this stage
of the negotiations, also, there had developed other
circumstances under which the “splendid” isolation
of Great Britain appeared less tenable than before.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Half a year after the Anglo-German Agreement was
rendered valueless by the declarations of Herr von
Bülow, the Czar paid a significant visit, in September,
not only to France, but also to Germany. The
ebullition of friendly sentiments between the heads
of the States was not less effervescent at Danzig
than at Dunkirk. The Russo-Chinese Bank presently
floated a loan of 80,000,000 marks at Berlin,
thus insuring to that extent the interests of
the Germans in Russian success in the East. At
the same time the situation in Manchuria had been
growing more serious than before, while Germany
had seemed no longer inclined to join Great
Britain in the latter’s protests against the menacing
conduct of Russia. Grave as was the danger to the
political and commercial prestige of Great Britain
in the East, her hands were still closely tied by the
vexatious South African question. If there ever
was need of an agreement with the rising Power
of the Orient, it had probably been never more
keenly felt by the British Government than in the
last part of the year 1901. Side by side with these
favorable circumstances for an understanding, the
student should not for a moment lose from sight
two fundamental conditions which drew together,
not only the Governments, but also the people, of
Great Britain and Japan with mutual attraction.
One was sentimental: each of the two nations found
in the other, though in different ways from one
another, something of a counterpart of its geographical
position, its material needs and aspirations, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the energy and enterprise of its individual members.
This mutual sympathy was largely intensified by,
not, indeed, so much the identity of their interests
in the East, as the common principles under which
these interests would be best protected—the independence
and strength of China and Korea, and the
equal opportunity therein for the economic enterprise
of all nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The final outcome of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations
was a remarkable product, the like of which
is seldom seen in history, especially when it is considered
that it united reciprocally two nations widely
apart in race, religion, and history, one of which
had rarely in time of peace entered into a regular
alliance even with a European Power.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c014'><sup>[402]</sup></a> The most
striking, as well as the most important for our
study, must be regarded the entirely fair and open
principles to which the Agreement gave clear expression.
These remarks may not be better substantiated
than by quoting the exact words of the
document itself, and of the dispatch inclosing the
Agreement from Lord Lansdowne to Sir Claude
MacDonald, the British Minister at Tokio, which
read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Governments of Great Britain and Japan, actuated
solely by a desire to maintain the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>general peace in the extreme East, being moreover specially
interested in maintaining the independence and territorial
integrity of the Empire of China and the Empire
of Korea, and in securing equal opportunities in those
countries for the commerce and industry of all nations,
hereby agree as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article I.</span> The High Contracting Parties having
mutually recognized the independence of China and
Korea, declare themselves to be entirely uninfluenced
by any aggressive tendencies in either country. Having
in view, however, their special interests, of which those
of Great Britain relate principally to China, while Japan,
in addition to the interests which she possesses in China,
is interested in a peculiar degree, politically as well as
commercially and industrially, in Korea, the High Contracting
Parties recognize that it will be admissible for
either of them to take such measures as may be indispensable
in order to safeguard those interests if threatened
either by the aggressive action of any other Power, or by
disturbances arising in China or Korea, and necessitating
the intervention of either of the High Contracting
Parties for the protection of the lives and property of its
subjects.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article II.</span> If either Great Britain or Japan, in the
defense of their respective interests as above described,
should become involved in war with another Power, the
other High Contracting Party will maintain a strict neutrality,
and use its efforts to prevent other Powers from
joining in hostilities against its ally.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article III.</span> If in the above event, any other Power
or Powers should join in hostilities against that ally, the
other High Contracting Party will come to its assistance,
and will conduct war in common, and will make peace in
mutual agreement with it.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article IV.</span> The High Contracting Parties agree that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>neither of them will, without consulting the other, enter
into separate arrangements with another Power to the
prejudice of the interests above described.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article V.</span> Whenever, in the opinion of either
Great Britain or Japan, the above-mentioned interests
are in jeopardy, the two Governments will communicate
with one another fully and frankly.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article VI.</span> The present Agreement shall come
into effect immediately after the date of its signature, and
remain in force for five years from that date.</p>

<p class='c032'>“In case neither of the High Contracting Parties
should have notified twelve months before the expiration
of the said five years the intention of terminating it, it
shall remain binding until the expiration of one year
from the day on which either of the High Contracting
Parties shall have denounced it. But if, when the date
fixed for its expiration arrives, either ally is actually engaged
in war, the alliance shall, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</span></i>, continue until
peace is concluded.</p>

<p class='c032'>“In faith whereof the Undersigned, duly authorized
by their respective Governments, have signed this Agreement,

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c032'>“I have signed to-day, with the Japanese Minister,
an Agreement between Great Britain and Japan, of
which a copy is inclosed in this dispatch.</p>

<p class='c032'>“This Agreement may be regarded as the outcome of
the events which have taken place during the past two
years in the Far East, and of the part taken by Great
Britain and Japan in dealing with them.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Throughout the troubles and complications which
arose in China consequent upon the Boxer outbreak and
the attack upon the Peking Legations, the two Powers
have been in close and uninterrupted communication,
and have been actuated by similar views.</p>

<p class='c032'>“We have each of us desired that the integrity and
independence of the Chinese Empire should be preserved,
that there should be no disturbance of the territorial
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> either in China or in the adjoining regions,
that all nations should, within those regions, as well as
within the limits of the Chinese Empire, be afforded
equal opportunities for the development of their commerce
and industry, and that peace should not only be
restored, but should, for the future, be maintained.</p>

<p class='c032'>“From the frequent exchanges of view which have
taken place between the two Governments, and from the
discovery that their Far Eastern policy was identical, it
has resulted that each side has expressed the desire that
their common policy should find expression in an international
contract of binding validity.</p>

<p class='c032'>“We have thought it desirable to record in the Preamble
of that instrument the main objects of our common
policy in the Far East to which I have already referred,
and in the first Article we join in entirely disclaiming any
aggressive tendencies either in China or Korea. We have,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>however, thought it necessary also to place on record the
view entertained by both the High Contracting Parties,
that should their interests as above described be endangered,
it will be admissible for either of them to take such
measures as may be indispensable in order to safeguard
their interests, and words have been added which will
render it clear that such precautionary measures might
become necessary and might be legitimately taken, not
only in the case of aggressive action or of an actual attack
of some other Power, but in the event of disturbances
arising of a character to necessitate the intervention of
either of the High Contracting Parties for the protection
of the lives and property of its subjects.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The principal obligations undertaken mutually by
the High Contracting Parties are those of maintaining a
strict neutrality in the event of either of them becoming
involved in war, and of coming to one another’s assistance
in the event of either of them being confronted by
the opposition of more than one hostile Power. Under
the remaining provisions of the Agreement, the High
Contracting Parties undertake that neither of them will,
without consultation with the other, enter into separate
arrangements with another Power to the prejudice of the
interests described in the Agreement, and that whenever
those interests are in jeopardy, they will communicate
with one another fully and frankly.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The concluding Article has reference to the duration
of the Agreement which, after five years, is terminable
by either of the High Contracting Parties at one year’s
notice.</p>

<p class='c032'>“His Majesty’s Government had been largely influenced
in their decision to enter into this important contract
by the conviction that it contains no provisions
which can be regarded as an indication of aggressive
or self-seeking tendencies in the regions to which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>applies. It has been concluded purely as a measure of
precaution, to be invoked, should occasion arise, in the
defence of important British interests. It in no way
threatens the present position or the legitimate interests
of other Powers. On the contrary, that part of it which
renders either of the High Contracting Parties liable to
be called upon by the other for assistance can operate
only when one of the allies has found himself obliged to
go to war in defence of interests which are common to
both, when the circumstances in which he has taken this
step are such as to establish that the quarrel has not been
of his own seeking, and when, being engaged in his own
defence, he finds himself threatened, not only by a single
Power, but by a hostile coalition.</p>

<p class='c032'>“His Majesty’s Government trust that the Agreement
may be found of mutual advantage to the two countries,
that it will make for the preservation of peace, and that,
should peace be unfortunately broken, it will have the
effect of restricting the area of hostilities.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The singular nature of these documents stands
out so clearly on their face that it hardly needs
a special reference. Not only has Manchuria at
last been clearly interpreted by both Powers as
lying within the scope of the Agreement, but it is
explicitly admitted therein that Japan possesses
extensive interests in the Korean peninsula, which
is for that reason included in the sphere within
which the contracting parties unequivocally disavow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>aggressive tendencies. Nor does this sum up
all the difference between this and the Anglo-German
Agreement, for, while in the latter the denial
of the parties’ aggressive designs was limited to the
period of the Boxer complication, and, moreover,
coupled with a reservation amounting to the recognition
of the theory of readjusting the balance
between the Powers at the expense of China, the
new alliance unconditionally upholds the independence
of China and Korea, and any measure, either
peaceful or warlike, taken by either party to safeguard
its interests, if they are in any way threatened,
would by no means alter its devotion to the
principles of the territorial integrity of the Chinese
and Korean Empires and of the open door in those
countries. The alliance exists solely for the purpose
of effectively safe-guarding the interests already
acquired by the two Powers on the common ground,
and it is implied in an unmistakable manner that
those interests may best be maintained by the total
abstention, in any event, from all aggressive or
exclusive tendencies in China and Korea, and,
what is equally important, that the observation of
these principles would forcibly tend to preserve the
general peace in the Far East. Owing to the covert
violation of these principles by another Power,
however, peace has been broken, but the Anglo-Japanese
Agreement has not expired. The latter would,
however, fall to the ground the moment one of the
parties, either as a result of a war or otherwise,
should attempt to depart from the principles of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>open door and the territorial integrity of the neighboring
Empires.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lord Lansdowne considered the Agreement “a
measure of precaution,” and hoped that it would
“make for the preservation of peace, and that,
should peace be unfortunately broken, it would have
the effect of restricting the area of hostilities.”
Presently these hopes were openly seconded, but
in reality neutralized, by the Russo-French Declaration
of March 17, which stated:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“The allied Governments of Russia and France have
received a copy of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of the
30th January, 1902, concluded with the object of maintaining
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> and the general peace in the Far
East, and preserving the independence of China and
Korea, which are to remain open to the commerce and
industry of all nations, and have been fully satisfied to
find therein affirmed the fundamental principles which
they have themselves, on several occasions, declared to
form the basis of their policy, and still remain so.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The two Governments consider that the observance
of these principles is at the same time a guarantee of
their special interests in the Far East.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c014'><sup>[405]</sup></a> Nevertheless,
being obliged themselves also to take into consideration
the case in which either the aggressive action of third
Powers, or the recurrence of disturbances in China,
jeopardizing the integrity and free development of that
Power, might become a menace to their own interests,
the two allied Governments reserve to themselves the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>right to consult in that contingency as to the means to be
adopted for securing those interests.”<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c014'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The St. Petersburg <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Officiel</span></cite> of March
20, published, with the Declaration, the statement
that the Russian Government had received the
announcement of the Anglo-Japanese Agreement
“with the most perfect calm,” for Russia likewise
insisted on the maintenance and integrity of China
and Korea. “Russia,” it continued to say, “desires
the preservation of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> and general
peace in the Far East, by the construction of the
great Siberian Railroad, together with its branch
line through Manchuria, toward a port always ice-free.
Russia aids in the extension in these regions
of the commerce and industry of the whole world.
Would it be to her interest to put forward obstacles
at the present time? The intention expressed
by Great Britain and Japan to attain those same
objects, which have invariably been pursued by the
Russian Government, can meet with nothing but
sympathy in Russia, in spite of the comments in
certain political spheres and in some of the foreign
newspapers, which endeavored to present in quite a
different light the impassive attitude of the Imperial
Government toward a diplomatic act which, in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>eye, does not change in any way the general situation
of the political horizon.”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c014'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to be generally overlooked that, so far
as the published documents are concerned, there
occurs no statement that the Russo-French alliance
extended from Europe to the Far East under precisely
the same conditions as those of the Anglo-Japanese
Agreement. In other words, although the
general principles of the latter are indorsed, one
finds nowhere that its terms of war and neutrality
and its provisions regarding the duration of the
validity of the instrument have also been reproduced
by Russia and France in their mutual convention.
Regarding the precise conditions of their
alliance, therefore, the world is left much in the
dark, save what it takes for granted. Nor are the
principles of the integrity and the open door of
China and Korea so fully and explicitly stated here
as in the Agreement of the rival allies, while the
reservation at the end of the Declaration does not
make it clear that these principles may not be discarded,
under certain circumstances, according to
the interpretations of the parties themselves of the
means to be taken to safeguard their interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning to the general tenor of the documents,
the student will at once observe their marked characteristics.
It is at least singular, one would think,
that the “most perfect calm” and the “impassive
attitude” of the Russian Government should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>expressed in so many words. If, again, the allied
Powers were, as they declare, in perfect accord with
the principles of Great Britain and Japan, it is not
intelligible why they should entertain, as it appears,
so deep a suspicion toward the “political spheres”
in which the Russian calmness was said to have been
deliberately misinterpreted, and also toward the
“third Powers” “whose aggressive action” might
“jeopardize the integrity and free development” of
China. This sense of distrust becomes all the more
pronounced when it is contrasted with the assertion
that the agreement between Great Britain and
Japan brought no change on the political horizon
of the East. It was reported about the time when
the Russian Minister and the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i>
at Tokio handed the Declaration to Baron
Komura, that the allied Powers had made their
Declaration because they feared that Great Britain
and Japan might, in virtue of the first Article of
their Agreement, object even to legitimate means
of protecting the French and Russian interests in
the Far East.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c014'><sup>[408]</sup></a> If the four Powers upheld the same
principles, no such apprehension of two of them
against the other two could be either cordial or even
justifiable. Under these considerations, one can
hardly avoid the conclusion that the allied Governments
of Russia and France must have been animated
less by the principles they professed than by
the deep rivalry of their interests with those of the
other allies. For it is at least certain that, ever since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>their memorable coalition with Germany in 1895,
in the coercion of Japan, Russia and France had
acted in mutual good-will, the former being mainly
aided by the latter in Manchuria and Korea, and
the latter by the former in the southern Chinese
provinces,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c014'><sup>[409]</sup></a> in their diplomatic manœuvres in those
countries and in their struggles with Japan and
Great Britain.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c014'><sup>[410]</sup></a> If the Agreement and the Declaration
are considered the formal expression of the
cordial sentiment which had long existed and been
growing between the two sets of the Powers, they
may be said to have brought no change upon the
political horizon; but it seems impossible to deny
that their publication greatly clarified the political
atmosphere in the East, and, in spite of the verbal
meaning of the declaration, not a little accentuated
the widening contrast between the two different policies
upheld by the two powerful coalitions. In this
sense, the political evolution of the Far East may
be said to have now reached an important stage
after the European intervention in Japan in 1895.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c014'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

event. By that time the allied forces had gradually
retired from North China, and the Chinese Court,
which had fled to Si-ngan, had retraced its steps to
Peking, arriving at the palace on January 7, 1902.
The political surroundings of the East seemed to
have assumed a somewhat more reassuring outlook,
except in Manchuria, than they had worn at
any time since the siege of the Legations in 1900.
The Russian Government seized this opportunity to
conclude with China, on April 8, 1902, along the
line suggested by the counter-draft of Prince Ching,
the now celebrated Convention providing for the
evacuation of Manchuria, which went into effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>simultaneously with its signature. We subjoin this
important document,<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c014'><sup>[413]</sup></a> together with the official statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>with which the former was published in the
St. Petersburg <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Officiel</span></cite> of April 12:—</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“The grave internal disorders which suddenly broke
out over the whole of China in the year 1900, exposing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the Imperial Mission and Russian subjects to danger,
obliged Russia to take decided measures to protect her
Imperial interests. With this object in view, the Imperial
Government, as is already known, dispatched a considerable
military force to Peking, which had been abandoned
by the Emperor and the Government authorities,
and introduced a Russian army into the frontier State
of Manchuria, to which the disorders in the Province of
Pechili had quickly spread, and were manifested by an
attack upon the Russian frontier by the native chiefs and
army, accompanied by a formal declaration of war on
Russia by the local Chinese authorities.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Nevertheless, the Imperial Government informed the
Government of the Emperor that Russia, in undertaking
these measures, had no hostile intentions toward China,
whose independence and integrity were the foundation
of Russian policy in the Far East.</p>

<p class='c032'>“True to these principles, Russia, as soon as the danger
threatening the Imperial Mission and Russian subjects
was over, withdrew her forces from Pechili before
any of the other Powers, and, at the first indication of
peace in Manchuria being restored, declared her readiness
to determine, in a private Agreement with China,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the manner and earliest date of her evacuation of that province,
with, however, certain guarantees of a temporary
nature, which were rendered necessary by the disorderly
condition of affairs in the above-mentioned province.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The conclusion of this Agreement dragged over
many months, owing to the difficult position in which the
high Chinese dignitaries were placed, being unable, in the
absence of the Court, to decide upon action, as becomes
the Representatives of a perfectly independent Empire.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Latterly, however, the pacification of China has progressed
with notable success. After the signature of the
Protocol of the 25th of August (7th September), 1901,
the Imperial Court returned to Peking; the central
lawful authority resumed its rights, and in many parts
of the Empire the local administrations were reëstablished.
At the first reception of the Corps Diplomatique
in Peking, the Chinese Empress expressed to the foreign
Representatives her gratitude for their coöperation in
suppressing the disturbances, and assured them of her
unshakable determination to take every measure for the
reëstablishment in the country of the normal state of
affairs existing before the disturbances arose.</p>

<p class='c032'>“This, indeed, solved the problem in which Russia
was principally interested when the disorders broke out
in the neighboring Empire. The Imperial Government,
pursuing no selfish aims, insisted that other Powers also
should not violate the independence and integrity of
China; and that the lawful Government, with which
Russia had concluded various agreements, should be
reinstated, and thus, when the disorders were over, the
friendly relations with China, which had existed from
time immemorial, should be continued.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Taking into consideration that this was the only object
with which Russian troops were sent into the Celestial
Empire, and that China has given written guarantee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>for the maintenance of order in the country, and repaid
Russia with material expenses to which she was put by
her military operations in China, the Imperial Government
henceforth sees no necessity for leaving armed forces
within the confines of the neighboring territory. Therefore,
by Imperial will, on the 26th March (April 8) was
signed by the Russian Minister at Peking, M. Lessar,
and by the Chinese Plenipotentiaries, the following Agreement
as to the conditions of the recall of the Russian
forces from Manchuria.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>“AGREEMENT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND CHINA RESPECTING MANCHURIA</h3>

<p class='c035'>“His Majesty the Emperor and Autocrat of All the
Russias, and His Majesty the Emperor of China, with
the object of reëstablishing and confirming the relations
of good neighborhood, which were disturbed by the
rising in the Celestial Empire of the year 1900, have
appointed their Plenipotentiaries to come to an agreement
on certain questions relating to Manchuria. These
Plenipotentiaries, furnished with full powers, which were
found to be in order, agreed as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 1.</span> His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of
Russia, desirous of giving fresh proof of his peaceable and
friendly disposition toward His Majesty the Emperor of
China, and overlooking the fact that attacks were first
made from frontier posts in Manchuria on peaceable Russian
settlements, agrees to the reëstablishment of the authority
of the Chinese Government in that region, which
remains an integral part of the Chinese Empire, and
restores to the Chinese Government the right to exercise
therein governmental and administrative authority,
as it existed previous to the occupation by Russian troops
of that region.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“<span class='sc'>Article 2.</span> In taking possession of the governmental
and administrative authority in Manchuria, the Chinese
Government confirms, both with regard to the period
and with regard to all other Articles, the obligation to
observe strictly the stipulations of the contract concluded
with the Russo-Chinese Bank on the 27th August, 1896,
and in virtue of paragraph 5 of the above-mentioned
contract, takes upon itself the obligation to use all means
to protect the railway and the persons in its employ, and
binds itself also to secure within the boundaries of Manchuria
the safety of all Russian subjects in general and
the undertakings established by them.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Russian Government, in view of these obligations
accepted by the Government of His Majesty the
Emperor of China, agrees on its side, provided that no
disturbances arise and that the action of other Powers
should not prevent it, to withdraw gradually all its forces
from within the limits of Manchuria in the following
manner:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“(a.) Within six months from the signature of the
Agreement to clear the southwestern portion of the Province
of Mukden up to the river Liao-ho of Russian
troops, and to hand the railways over to China.</p>

<p class='c032'>“(b.) Within further six months to clear the remainder
of the Province of Mukden and the Province of Kirin
of Imperial troops.</p>

<p class='c032'>“(c.) Within the six months following to remove the
remaining Imperial Russian troops from the Province of
Hei-lung-chang.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 3.</span> In view of the necessity of preventing in
the future any recurrence of the disorders of last year, in
which Chinese troops stationed on the Manchurian frontier
also took part, the Imperial Russian and Chinese
Governments shall undertake to instruct the Russian
military authorities and the Tsiang-Tsungs, mutually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to come to an agreement respecting the numbers and the
disposition of the Chinese forces until the Russian forces
shall have been withdrawn. At the same time the Chinese
Government binds itself to organize no other forces over
and above those decided upon by the Russian military
authorities and the Tsiang-Tsungs as sufficient to suppress
brigandage and pacify the country.</p>

<p class='c032'>“After the complete evacuation of Manchuria by Russian
troops, the Chinese Government shall have the right
to increase or diminish the number of its troops in Manchuria,
but of this must duly notify the Russian Government,
as it is natural that the maintenance in the above-mentioned
district of an over large number of troops
must necessarily lead to a reinforcement of the Russian
military force in the neighboring districts, and thus would
bring about an increase of expenditure on military requirements
undesirable for both States.</p>

<p class='c032'>“For police service and maintenance of internal order
in the districts outside those parts allotted to the Eastern
Chinese Railway Company, a police guard, under the
local Governors (‘Tsiang-Tsungs’), consisting of cavalry
and infantry, shall be organized exclusively of subjects
of His Majesty the Emperor of China.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 4.</span> The Russian Government agrees to
restore to the owners the Railway Shan-hai-kwan-Niu-chwang-Sinminting,
which, since the end of September,
1900, has been occupied and guarded by Russian troops.
In view of this, the Government of His Majesty the Emperor
of China binds itself:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. In case protection of the above-mentioned line
should be necessary, that obligation shall fall exclusively
on the Chinese Government, which shall not invite other
Powers to participate in its protection, construction, or
working, nor allow other Powers to occupy the territory
evacuated by the Russians.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>“2. The completion and working of the above-mentioned
line shall be conducted in strict accordance with
the Agreement between Russia and England of the 16th
April, 1899, and the Agreement with the private Corporation
respecting the loan for the construction of the line.
And furthermore, the corporation shall observe its obligations
not to enter into possession of, or in any way to
administer, the Shan-hai-kwan-Niu-chwang-Sinminting
line.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. Should, in the course of time, extensions of the
line in Southern Manchuria, or construction of branch
lines in connection with it, or the erection of a bridge in
Niu-chwang, or the moving of the terminus there, be
undertaken, these questions shall first form the subject
of mutual discussion between the Russian and Chinese
Governments.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. In view of the fact that the expenses incurred by
the Russian Government for the repair and working of
the Shan-hai-kwan-Niu-chwang-Sinminting line were not
included in the sum total of damages, the Chinese Government
shall be bound to pay back the sum which,
after examination with the Russian Government, shall be
found to be due.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The stipulations of all former Treaties between Russia
and China which are not affected by the present Agreement
shall remain in force.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Agreement shall have legal force from the day of
its signature by the Plenipotentiaries of both States.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The exchange of ratifications shall take place in St.
Petersburg within three months from the date of the signature
of the Agreement.</p>

<p class='c032'>“For the confirmation of the above, the Plenipotentiaries
of the two Contracting Powers have signed and
sealed two copies of the Agreement in the Russian,
French, and Chinese languages. Of the three texts which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>after comparison, have been found to correspond with
each other, that in the French language shall be considered
as authoritative for the interpretation of the
Agreement.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Done in Peking in duplicate, the 26th March, 1902.”</p>

<p class='c032'>“At the same time, M. Lessar handed a note to the
Chinese Plenipotentiaries, which declares, in the name of
the Imperial Government, that the surrender of the civil
government of Niu-chwang into the hands of the Chinese
administration will take place only upon the withdrawal
from that part of foreign forces and landing parties, and
the restoration to the Chinese of the town of Tien-tsin,
at present under international administration.</p>

<p class='c032'>“From the above, it is shown that the Imperial Government,
in complete adherence to its repeated declarations,
commences the gradual evacuation of Manchuria
in order to carry it out upon the conditions above enumerated,
if no obstacles are placed in the way by the
unexpected action of other Powers or of China herself;
that the surrender of the civil government of Niu-chwang
into the hands of the Chinese administration is to take
place according to a written declaration given to the
Celestial Government, only when foreign forces and landing
parties are withdrawn from the port, and if, at the
same time, the question of the restoration of Tien-tsin to
the Chinese has been conclusively settled.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Chinese Government, on its side, confirms all
the obligations it has previously undertaken toward Russia,
and particularly the provisions of the 1896 Agreement,
which must serve as a basis for the friendly relations
of the neighboring Empires. By this defensive
Agreement, Russia undertook in 1896 to maintain the
principle of the independence and integrity of China,
who, on her side, gave Russia the right to construct a line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>through Manchuria and to enjoy the material privileges
which are directly connected with the above undertaking.</p>

<p class='c032'>“After the instructive events of the last two years, it is
possible to hope for the complete pacification of the Far
East, and the development of friendly relations with
China in the interests of the two Empires. But, undoubtedly,
if the Chinese Government, in spite of their positive
assurances, should, on any pretext, violate the above
conditions, the Imperial Government would no longer
consider itself bound by the provisions of the Manchurian
Agreement, nor by its declarations on this subject, and
would have to decline to take the responsibility for all
the consequences which might ensue.”<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c014'><sup>[414]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The comparatively mild terms of this Convention
may well be pointed out.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c014'><sup>[415]</sup></a> Except in the negative
reservations of Article 4, there is found here no
provision for the exclusive control by the Russians
of the mining and railway enterprises either in or
out of Manchuria. On the contrary, the sovereign
rights in Manchuria, including those respecting
the disposition of military forces, will in eighteen
months be almost completely restored to the Chinese
Government, and the entire agreement will become
operative from the very day of its signature. The
Convention seemed to confirm the avowed intention
of Russia to love peace and respect the integrity of
China. It is not strange that Prince Ching personally
thanked Great Britain, Japan, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>United States for the valuable support they had
rendered China in the negotiations which had terminated
in the conclusion of this instrument.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c014'><sup>[416]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If, however, the subsequent conduct of Russia in
Manchuria has appeared to contradict the tenor of
the Agreement, it is only necessary to point out how
elastic and expansive its terms are. Paragraph 5,
Article 2, of the Bank Agreement of September 8,
1896, imposing upon the Chinese Government the
duty to protect the Manchurian Railway and the persons
employed in it, is not only reinforced but also
expanded so as to make it incumbent upon China
“to secure within the boundaries of Manchuria the
safety of all Russian subjects in general and the
undertakings established by them.” Unless Manchuria
is considered a territory distinct from the rest
of the Chinese Empire, no Russians or other foreigners
have the right to reside in the interior save
in the treaty posts. Yet the Chinese Government
is held responsible for the security of the Russians
and their enterprises in Manchuria, which is regarded
virtually as a Russian colony, into which
immigrants from Siberia and European Russia have
been sent with wonderful rapidity. Nor does this
additional obligation on the part of China any
longer bind her to a private company called the
Russo-Chinese Bank, but henceforth to the Government
of the Czar. The discharge of so onerous a
duty is made a condition for the Russian evacuation
of Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>It is not generally known that this condition,
otherwise so difficult, was practically impossible so
long as the presence of the Russian forces kept the
Chinese troops greatly reduced in number. The
apprehended disorder must come, as it always has
done, and as none knew better than the Russians,
from the groups of unoccupied men, the so-called
mounted bandits (<em>ma tseh</em>), who infested the
Provinces of Sheng-king and Kirin, where they
sided with whatever power suited their fancy and
interest, exercised their own law, and in one way or
another kept the country in a state of great instability.
It should be noted that they were either disbanded
soldiers or the possible candidates for the
Chinese troops to be levied to safeguard Manchuria—for
military life in China seldom attracts peaceful
citizens. So long as the presence of the Russian
forces rendered the regular service of the outlaws
in the Chinese army unnecessary, their means of
subsistence would be derived less often from a
settled agricultural life than from plundering. Between
March, 1902, and August, 1903, a Russian
officer successfully enlisted the service of some 450
of these marauders, and employed them in the timber
work which the Russians secured in Eastern
Manchuria in the name of one of the chiefs of the
bandits.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c014'><sup>[417]</sup></a> Before and after this period, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>the Russian officers continually reported sanguinary
conflicts with the robbers, the fear of whom has
seemed to constitute the main justification for the
steady progress of the Russian measures of tightening
a hold upon Manchuria.<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c014'><sup>[418]</sup></a> Side by side with this
grave situation, we should also observe that the
Convention provided that, even after the evacuation,
if an evacuation were possible, the numbers
and the stations of the Chinese troops, upon whom
the duty of protecting the rapidly increasing Russian
subjects and properties in Manchuria would
devolve, should always be made known to Russia,
so that unnecessarily large forces should not be
stationed. Russia would judge whether the Chinese
forces were excessive, and exert her influence to
keep them in reduced numbers,<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c014'><sup>[419]</sup></a> while, at the same
time, their capacity as well for receiving the banditti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>into their ranks as for affording protection to the
Russian life and property would, to say the least,
soon reach its limits. Thus the explicit terms of
the Convention were constructed so as to be greatly
neutralized, as it would seem, by what was implied
and could only be inferred by analysis. In the light
of these considerations may be seen the statement
that, “undoubtedly, if the Chinese Government, in
spite of their positive assurances, should, on any
pretext, violate the above conditions [i. e., of the
Convention], the Imperial Government would no
longer consider itself bound by the provisions of
the Manchurian Agreement, nor by its declarations
on this subject, and would have to decline to take
the responsibility for all the consequences which
might ensue,”<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c014'><sup>[420]</sup></a>—a reservation which Count Lamsdorff
considered “a very necessary one.”<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c014'><sup>[421]</sup></a> In the
same light, also, one may read the statement made
by Sir Ernest Satow to Prince Ching, that “the
Convention did not appear to His Majesty’s Government
to be entirely satisfactory,”<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c014'><sup>[422]</sup></a> and also the
pungent remark of Lord Lansdowne to M. de Staal,
that there were several points in the Agreement
which had caused much criticism in England, particularly
those provisions which limited China’s right
to dispose of her own military forces and to construct
railway extensions within her own territory.
“I did not, however,” adds the Marquess, “desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to examine these provisions too microscopically, and
I shared his [M. de Staal’s] hope that the Agreement
would be loyally and considerately interpreted
on both sides, and that the evacuation of the province
would be completed within the appointed
time.”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c014'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The last but not the least difficulty about the
Agreement was its absolute silence regarding the
so-called “railway guards,” organized ostensibly by
the Eastern Chinese Railway Company, whose existence
would make the promised evacuation almost
entirely nominal. It will be remembered that, so
far as the published agreements between China and
Russia are concerned, one fails to find any conventional
ground for the organization of the railway
guards, save in Article 8 of the Statutes—not a
Russo-Chinese agreement, but purely Russian statutes—published
on December 11/13, 1896, which
provided: “The preservation of order and decorum
on the lands assigned to the railway and its appurtenances
should be confined to the <em>police agents</em>
appointed by the Company. The Company should
draw up and establish police regulations.”<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c014'><sup>[424]</sup></a> This
right of Russia to police the railway lands seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to have been tacitly perpetuated by the present
Convention of 1902,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c014'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and, from this, it may perhaps
be assumed that the Chinese Government had
some time before April 8, 1902, agreed to the
statutory rule of Russia which has just been quoted.
However that may be, a permission to establish a
police force could scarcely justify the organization
of railway guards selected from the regular troops
and receiving a higher pay than the latter. Moreover,
it still remains to be officially declared that
the numbers of the guards would not be determined
by Russia at will and without consulting
China. These guards seem to have numbered only
2000 or 3000 before the Manchurian campaign of
1900, but in October of that year Mr. Charles Hardinge,
the British <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i> at St. Petersburg,
wrote to Lord Salisbury: “I learn that active
recruiting for this force is now in progress, and
its numbers are to be raised to 12,000 men under
command of officers in the regular army. Intrenched
camps are also being constructed at all the strategic
positions along the line.”<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c014'><sup>[426]</sup></a> Then, on the eve
of the termination of the first period of evacuation
in 1902, it was reported by Consul Hosie: “I am
credibly informed that the number of the military
guard of the Russian railways in Manchuria has
been fixed at 30,000 men.”<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c014'><sup>[427]</sup></a> Latterly, the name has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>been changed to the “frontier guards,” which, after
the beginning of the present war, were said to have
been made up of fifty-five mounted squadrons, fifty-five
foot companies, and six batteries of artillery,
aggregating 25,000 men, instead of 30,000, and
guarding the railways in sections of thirty-three
miles.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c014'><sup>[428]</sup></a> There is no intention here to maintain the
accuracy of these reports, or to decide whether the
numbers are adequate for the purpose in view, but
one would be tempted to think that the Russian
Government made a regrettable omission in the new
Manchurian Agreement, when it made no reference
to the forces which were justified by no open contract
with China, and, theoretically speaking, were
not incapable of an indefinite expansion.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <span class='large'>THE EVACUATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Unsatisfactory as the Manchurian Agreement of
April 8, 1902, appeared to Great Britain and Japan,
they refrained from entering any protest against its
conclusion. They probably preferred the imperfect
obligation the Convention imposed upon the contracting
parties to an indefinite prolongation of the
dangerous conditions which had prevailed. What
remained for them and for China was to watch the
conduct of Russia in Manchuria and test her veracity
according to their own interpretations of the Agreement.
In the mean time, the questions which had
existed between China and the Powers were being
one after another disposed of; the distribution of
the indemnities was finally agreed upon on June 14,
the Provisional Government of Tien-tsin by the
Powers came to an end on August 15, and the
rendition of the city to the Chinese authorities was
accomplished. The date set for the evacuation of
the southwest of the Sheng-king Province up to the
Liao River, October 8, drew on, and the evacuation
took place. The Tartar General Tsêng-chi had
received an Imperial mandate to take over from
the hands of the Russians the specified territory
and its railways, even before the middle of September,<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c014'><sup>[429]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>and, on October 28, Prince Ching was able to
state to Sir Ernest Satow: “Their Excellencies the
Minister Superintendent of Northern Ports and the
Military Governor of Mukden have now severally
reported by telegram that all the railways outside
the Great Wall have been handed back, and that
the southwest portion of the Mukden (Sheng-king)
Province as far as the Liao River has been completely
evacuated by Russian troops.”<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c014'><sup>[430]</sup></a> But what
was evacuation? Some troops may have been sent
to European Russia, others to different stations
in Siberia, including the strategically important
Nikolsk, near the eastern border of Manchuria,
and still others to Mongolia, where Russian forces
were reported to have suddenly increased, until in
December they were said to have numbered about
27,000.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c014'><sup>[431]</sup></a> No small number were also transferred to
Port Arthur<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c014'><sup>[432]</sup></a> and Vladivostok.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c014'><sup>[433]</sup></a> It was, however, alleged
by several observers that the main part of the
so-called evacuation meant nothing more than the
transferring of Russian troops from Chinese towns
and settlements to the rapidly developing Russian
settlements and quarters within Manchuria. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>reported from various sources<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c014'><sup>[434]</sup></a> that along the 2326
versts of the railroads there were about eighty so-called
depots, each two to five square miles in extent,
which had been marked out as the sites of new
Russian settlements, and in many cases as stations
of the railway guards. The most important line,
connecting Port Arthur with Harbin, was studded
with such depots at every fifteen or twenty miles.
In many of these depots were to be seen extensive
barracks built of brick, one at Liao-yang, for
example, being capable of holding 3000 men,
and another at Mukden, in the building of which
bricks of the wall of the Chinese Temple of Earth
were surreptitiously utilized,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c014'><sup>[435]</sup></a> accommodating 6000.
Besides the barracks, permanent blockhouses were
met with every three or four miles. The guards
of the railways, whose numbers were just at this
time fixed at 30,000,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c014'><sup>[436]</sup></a> were recruited from the regular
troops, from whom they were distinguished by
green shoulder-straps and collar-patches, and also by
higher pay, and the regular troops themselves could
be contained in large numbers in the depots and
barracks and blockhouses when the evacuation was
completed.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c014'><sup>[437]</sup></a> At the same time, the Russians seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to have destroyed nearly all the forts and confiscated
the guns of the Chinese, whose defense had
thus been reduced almost to nil. The military
power of the Tartar Generals at the capitals of the
three Manchurian Provinces was held under a strict
surveillance of the Russian officers, who also readily
controlled highroads and rivers. It was, moreover,
uncertain how much of this control and supervision
by the Russians would be relaxed after the
promised evacuation, or how much it would then
be replaced by the powerful position the Russians
would hold in their own quarters in Manchuria.
The conclusion seemed inevitable to some people
that by the so-called evacuation, if it should ever
take place in the face of the enormous obstacles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>which the Agreement did not seek to remove,
Russia would gain a much stronger hold upon the
Manchurian territory than during the preceding
period of open military occupation.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c014'><sup>[438]</sup></a> It was also
pointed out that the forts, docks, and other military
and naval establishments at Port Arthur, costing
millions of rubles, were not compatible with the
short term of the lease of the port, and their practical
value would be seriously impaired by a true
evacuation of the rest of Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c007'>So far as the immediate interests of foreign
nations, aside from the general principle of the integrity
of the Chinese Empire, were concerned,
nothing was more to be desired than a speedy
evacuation of the treaty port of Niu-chwang, where
the Russians had maintained a provisional government
since August 5, 1900.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c014'><sup>[439]</sup></a> At the conclusion of
the Agreement of April, 1901, M. Lessar delivered
a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">note verbale</span></i> to the Chinese Government, stating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>that Niu-chwang would be restored as soon as the
Powers terminated their administration of Tien-tsin,
and that, if the latter event did not take place
before October 8, then Niu-chwang would be surrendered
to China in the first or second month
after that date.<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c014'><sup>[440]</sup></a> The rendition of Tien-tsin was accomplished
by the Powers on August 15, but the
restoration of Niu-chwang not only did not follow
it, but seemed to be indefinitely delayed for the
trivial reasons presented one after another by the
Russian authorities: that, for instance, one or two
foreign gunboats were present in the harbor;<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c014'><sup>[441]</sup></a> that
the Chinese had refused to agree to the constitution
of a sanitary board;<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c014'><sup>[442]</sup></a> and that the Chinese Tao-tai
detailed to receive back the civil government of the
port had not arrived from Mukden, where, it has
been discovered, he had been detained by the Russians
much against his will.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c014'><sup>[443]</sup></a> Up to the present
time, the maritime customs dues at this important
trade port have been paid to the Russo-Chinese
Bank, and, for a large sum thus received, the Bank
is said to have paid to the Chinese authorities neither
the amount nor the interest.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c014'><sup>[444]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>DEMANDS IN SEVEN ARTICLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The most important section of Manchuria, strategically,
namely, that part of the Province of Sheng-king
which lies east of the Liao River and the entire
Province of Kirin, was to be evacuated, according
to the Agreement, before April 8, 1903. As that
date drew near, and long afterward, the disposition
of the Russian forces appeared incompatible
with even the nominal withdrawal which characterized
the first period of evacuation. It is true that
in the Sheng-king Province, except the regions
bordering on the Yalu River on the Korean frontier,
the Russian troops began to withdraw soon
after the end of the first period, but only “to the
railway line.”<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c014'><sup>[445]</sup></a> The important border regions, especially
Fêng-hwang-Chêng and An-tung, however,
remained in Russian occupation, the former still
holding 700 cavalry in June.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c014'><sup>[446]</sup></a> From March, there
had been mysterious movements of small detachments
of troops toward this frontier,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c014'><sup>[447]</sup></a> of which
Count Lamsdorff and M. Witte alike professed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>a complete ignorance,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c014'><sup>[448]</sup></a> but concerning which M.
Plançon, the Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i> at Peking,
had made an explanation which seemed utterly unintelligible,
that the Russian troops had been moved
in order to counteract a threatened Japanese movement.
It soon appeared, however, that the Russians
had begun to cut timber on both sides of the
Yalu River,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c014'><sup>[449]</sup></a> and, with the consent of Admiral
Alexieff, had hired the services of some Russian
soldiers,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c014'><sup>[450]</sup></a> some of whom had gone to Yong-am-po
on the Korean side of the Yalu.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c014'><sup>[451]</sup></a> The detachments
outside of Fêng-hwang-Chêng, amounting at first
to only five men at Tatung-kao and twenty at
Yong-am-po, would have been small enough to be
ignored, had it not been for the significant fact
that the occupation of Yong-am-po, which will be
discussed later on,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c014'><sup>[452]</sup></a> constituted a menace to the integrity
of the Korean Empire similar to one which
threatened China when Russia leased Port Arthur;
for a railway concession granted in the Russo-Chinese
Agreement of March 27, 1898,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c014'><sup>[453]</sup></a> would bring
this port into connection with the entire railroad
and military system of Manchuria and the great
Russian Empire. Further west, at Liao-yang, except
the nominal withdrawal reported in the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>August,<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c014'><sup>[454]</sup></a> there was no indication of its evacuation,<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c014'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
and at Mukden, the capital of Sheng-king,
3200 soldiers, who constituted the major part of
the forces, were reported to have evacuated,<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c014'><sup>[456]</sup></a> but
the remainder, after proceeding to the train, suddenly
returned and took up their old quarters,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c014'><sup>[457]</sup></a>
some or all of them wearing civilian dress.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c014'><sup>[458]</sup></a> It is
unknown whither the 3200 men had gone, but the
Russian Consul merely moved to the railway outside
the town.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c014'><sup>[459]</sup></a> To the north, it was evident in May that
the Province of Kirin had hardly begun to be
evacuated even in the nominal sense, as in parts of
the Sheng-king Province.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c014'><sup>[460]</sup></a> So late as in September,
the Russian authorities at Peking talked to Prince
Ching of leaving 6000 or 7000 troops in the Kirin
and Hei-lung Provinces for another year.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c014'><sup>[461]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Long before September, however, it had become
apparent that the delay in the second part of the
Manchurian evacuation was due to no casual event.
The appointed time-limit, the 8th of April, had
hardly been twenty days past, with no signs indicative
of a possible speedy withdrawal, when new
demands in seven articles of an highly exclusive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>nature, which the Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i> had
lodged at the Foreign Office of Peking,<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c014'><sup>[462]</sup></a> leaked
out,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c014'><sup>[463]</sup></a> were confirmed by Prince Ching,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c014'><sup>[464]</sup></a> and spread
broadcast over the astonished world. Further evacuation
was probably implied, if not declared, to be
dependent upon the acceptance of these demands,<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c014'><sup>[465]</sup></a>
the most authentic version<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c014'><sup>[466]</sup></a> of which is here subjoined:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. No portion of territory restored to China by Russia,
especially at Niu-chwang and in the valley of Liao-ho,
shall be leased or sold to any other Power under any
circumstances; if such sale or lease to another Power be
concluded, Russia will take decisive steps in order to
safeguard her own interests, as she considers such sale
or lease to be a menace to her.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. The system of government actually existing
throughout Mongolia shall not be altered, as such alteration
will tend to produce a regrettable state of affairs, such
as the uprising of the people and the disturbances along
the Russian frontier; the utmost precaution shall be
taken in that direction.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“3. China shall engage herself not to open, of her own
accord, new ports or towns in Manchuria, without giving
previous notice to the Russian Government, nor shall
she permit foreign consuls to reside in those towns or
ports.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. The authority of foreigners who may be engaged
by China for the administration of any affairs whatever,
shall not be permitted to extend over any affairs in
Northern Provinces (including Chili), where Russia has
the predominant interests.</p>

<p class='c032'>“In case China desires to engage foreigners for the
administration of affairs in Northern Provinces, special
offices shall be established for the control of Russians: for
instance, no authority over the mining affairs of Mongolia
and Manchuria shall be given to foreigners who may be
engaged by China for the administration of mining affairs;
such authority shall be left entirely in the hands
of Russian experts.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. As long as there exists a telegraph line at Niu-chwang
and Port Arthur, the Niu-chwang-Peking line shall be
maintained, as the telegraph line at Niu-chwang and
Port Arthur and throughout Sheng-king Province is
under Russian control, and its connection with her line on
the Chinese telegraph poles at Niu-chwang, Port Arthur,
and Peking is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='c032'>“6. After restoring Niu-chwang to the Chinese local
authorities, the customs receipts there shall, as at present,
be deposited with the Russo-Chinese Bank.</p>

<p class='c032'>“7. After the evacuation of Manchuria, the rights
which have been acquired in Manchuria by Russian subjects
and foreign companies during Russian occupation
shall remain unaffected; moreover, as Russia is duty-bound
to insure the life of the people residing in all the
regions traversed by the railway, it is necessary, in order
to provide against the spread of epidemic diseases in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Northern Provinces by the transportation of passengers
and goods by railway train, to establish at Niu-chwang
a quarantine office after the restoration of the place to
China; the Russian civil administrators will consider the
best means to attain that end. Russians only shall be
employed at the posts of Commissioner of Customs and
Customs Physician, and they shall be placed under the
control of the Inspector-General of the Imperial Maritime
Customs. These officials shall perform their duties conscientiously,
shall protect the interests of the Imperial
maritime customs, and shall exhaust their efforts in
preventing the spread of those diseases into the Russian
territories. A permanent Sanitary Board, presided
over by the Customs Tao-tai, shall be established. The
foreign Consuls, Commissioner of Customs, Customs
Physician, and Agent of the Chinese Eastern Railway
Company shall be Councilors of the Board. As regards
the establishment of the Board and the management of
its affairs, the Customs Tao-tai shall consult with the
Russian Consul, and the Customs Tao-tai shall devise
the best means to obtain funds necessary for the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These demands, as will be seen, comprised,
besides the non-alienation of Manchuria to any other
Power, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</span></i> in Mongolia, drastic
measures of closing the former territory against the
economic enterprise of all nations but the Russians;
and, in that respect, were supplementary to the
Agreement concluded a year before, which studiously
omitted clauses prejudicial to the principle
of the open door. From the standpoint of this last
principle, therefore, no demands could be more objectionable
than those now presented by M. Plançon.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>The Empress Dowager of China was said to have
sneered at the report, and to have remarked that,
if she had been disposed to grant such demands, she
would never have requested the Powers to withdraw
as soon as possible their forces from North China.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c014'><sup>[467]</sup></a>
Prince Ching not only considered the Russian terms
quite unacceptable, but failed to see any reason or
right on the part of Russia to impose fresh conditions
which infringed China’s sovereign rights.
He accordingly refused to entertain these conditions,
perhaps on April 23.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c014'><sup>[468]</sup></a> The Japanese Government
had already entered a firm protest,<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c014'><sup>[469]</sup></a> and was followed
by that of the British Government, which
considered the demands as violating the most-favored-nation
clause, and otherwise highly inadmissible.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c014'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
Before the British protest reached him, Mr.
Townley, the British <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i>, had assured Prince
Ching that the latter would receive from Great
Britain similar support in resisting the Russian demands
to that which was given him during the negotiation
of the Manchurian Convention.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c014'><sup>[471]</sup></a> Soon
afterward, the United States Government also instructed
Mr. Conger to urge on the Peking Foreign
Office the advisability of refusing the first and
second of the conditions laid down by Russia, and,
moreover, made direct inquiries at the Russian Government
in a friendly spirit, pointing out that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>reported demands were not in accordance with the
proposed stipulations contained in the new draft
treaty between the United States and China, a copy
of which was communicated to Count Lamsdorff.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c014'><sup>[472]</sup></a>
This latter act of Secretary Hay was promptly
followed by Great Britain, whose Government
instructed its Ambassador at St. Petersburg to address
the Foreign Minister in language similar to
that used by the American Representative.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c014'><sup>[473]</sup></a> It
may be safely inferred that the Japanese Government
also took a similar step. There thus resulted
a natural coöperation between the three Powers,
whose straightforward policy was clearly expressed
by Lord Lansdowne as follows: “To open China
impartially to the commerce of the whole world, to
maintain her independence and integrity, and to
insist upon the fulfillment of treaty and other
obligations by the Chinese Government which they
have contracted towards us.”<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c014'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>According to the instructions he had received
from his Government, Mr. MacCormick, the United
States Ambassador, had an interview with Count
Lamsdorff in the evening of April 28. The Count at
once denied in the most positive manner that such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>demands as were rumored had been made by the
Russian Government. He expressed surprise that
they should have been credited in any quarter, and
that a friendly government like that of the United
States should be the only one to question him as to
whether Russia could have made demands some of
which were on the face of them ridiculous, as, for
instance, those for the right of using China’s telegraph
poles and for the restriction of foreign trade
in Manchuria. It may be questioned whether Count
Lamsdorff has ever made to a strong Power another
denial in as positive language, which was, one
will soon observe, as quickly falsified by subsequent
events, as this remarkable disclaimer of April 28,
1903. He went on to say that he could give the
United States Government the most positive assurances
that Russia would faithfully adhere to its
pledges regarding Manchuria, and to her assurances
to respect the rights of other Powers. Moreover,
American capital and commerce were what Russia
most desired to attract in order to develop Manchuria.
The Count also intimated that any delay in
the evacuation was due to the natural necessity of
obtaining assurances that China was fulfilling her
part of the agreement. This could be better ascertained
by the Russian Minister, M. Lessar, who
had been absent from Peking on sick leave, but
was about to return to his post, than by an acting
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i>.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c014'><sup>[475]</sup></a> A careful reading of this disclaimer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>will show that it denied that the reported
demands had been made by Russia, but it did not
establish that no demands whatsoever had been
made by her. This consideration would seem to
make it truly remarkable that Mr. MacCormick
should have been, as he was, entirely satisfied with
the result of the interview, and should have had no
further remark to make. He could perhaps have
inquired whether M. Plançon had acted without
authorization, what were the conditions he had proposed,
and by what means M. Lessar was expected
to obtain the assurances from China that her obligations
would be fulfilled.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c014'><sup>[476]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The positive statements of Count Lamsdorff were
partly reinforced and partly neutralized by the
clever remarks made on April 29 by Count Cassini,
the Russian Ambassador at Washington, which
appeared in the New York <cite>Tribune</cite> of May 1. He
considered it unfortunate that Mr. Conger should
have been misinformed, by unreliable parties, of
Russia’s intentions in Manchuria, of which they
were grossly ignorant,—a matter which was regretted,
he was sure, no less by the American Government
than by Russia. He, however, not only
intimated that some sort of negotiation was in progress
between Russia and China regarding Manchuria,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>but was bold enough to say that the United
States would assist Russia in quieting the uneasy
sentiment caused by false reports. He said:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Because of the singularity of the interest held by the
United States in Manchuria—for all the world realizes
that yours is a trade, not a territorial one—it lies within
the power of your Government to exert a powerful influence
in the preservation of peace there. Russia’s desire
is also for peace, not disturbances, in Manchuria, and
it is to this end that negotiations are now proceeding in
Peking in the effort to establish a condition of evacuation,
and to safeguard Manchuria against a recurrence of
the troubles of 1900.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Striking evidence of the direct effect in this country
caused by unrest in China was seen in 1900, when, I am
told, many cotton mills in the United States were forced
to shut down until conditions in China were again normal.
This fact and the evidence the United States has already
given of its desire to make for peace are sufficient assurance
that the Washington Government will lend its strong
moral support to calm excitement wherever it has been
aroused by the incorrect reports from Peking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Count Cassini, it was “because of
the long standing and genuine friendliness which,
without exception, had characterized the relations
of these two great countries, as well as in recognition
of the frankness with which the American
Secretary of State had dealt with my Government
in all diplomatic matters,” that the latter took
pleasure in assuring the United States regarding
negotiations pending with another Power, “even
though in so doing all diplomatic precedent was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>broken.” “I am not aware,” he said, “that any
other Powers have received from the Foreign Office
[of St. Petersburg] such a statement as was handed
your Ambassador.” In referring to Mr. MacCormick’s
interview, however, it will be seen that
Count Lamsdorff made no direct reference to the
negotiations at Peking, still less to their contents,
and the assurances he gave had before and have
since been frequently and in similar terms repeated
to other Powers by Russia.</p>

<p class='c007'>By far the most illuminating part of M. Cassini’s
conversation was its practical confirmation of the
truth of one of the reported demands of Russia
which were considered the most objectionable, and
which Count Lamsdorff specifically denied, characterizing
them “as on the face of them ridiculous,”
namely, that no new ports should be opened in
Manchuria for the world’s trade. “Of the opening
of new treaty ports in Manchuria,” said M. Cassini,
“it is impossible for me to speak at present, but it
is the earnest conviction of those best acquainted
with the state of affairs there that such a move will
not be to the best interest of the territory. Were
the question solely a commercial one, it would be
different. But open a treaty port in Manchuria,
and close upon the heels of commerce will follow
political complications of all kinds, which will
increase the threats to peace.” In this statement
Count Cassini not only virtually contradicted Count
Lamsdorff, but also, as we shall soon see, was subsequently
contradicted by the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>A careful reader of these words uttered by one
of Russia’s greatest diplomatic agents abroad will
feel satisfied that, despite Count Lamsdorff’s elastic
statement to the contrary, Russia was actually proposing
some terms to China, and that one of those
terms probably was that Manchuria should have no
more treaty ports. When diplomacy relies, even to
a slight extent, upon subterfuges, it risks a certain
lack of consistent unity among its exponents, and
the rule could hardly have for exceptions even such
highly trained diplomats as Lamsdorff and Cassini.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count Lamsdorff’s disclaimer was uttered on
April 28, and Count Cassini’s statement was dated
April 29 and appeared in the press on May 1. In
the mean time, the Foreign Office of Peking had
refused the Russian conditions in an official note.
Yet, on April 29, M. Plançon suggested that each
condition might be answered separately, and the
suggestion was verbally refused by Prince Ching.
Thereupon the Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> presented a note
intimating that his Government wished to be assured
on the first three of the original demands,
namely, whether a territorial cession to another
power in the Liao Valley was contemplated by
China; whether there was an intention to assimilate
the administration of Mongolia to that of China
proper; and whether China would permit the appointment
of foreign Consuls in Manchuria in
other places than Niu-chwang. In reply, Prince
Ching stated, naturally, that there had never been
any question of ceding territory in the Liao Valley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>to a foreign Power; that the question of altering
the administrative system of Mongolia had been
discussed, but it had been disapproved by the
Throne, and was not under consideration for the
present; and that, in regard to the appointment of
new Consuls in Manchuria, it depended upon the
opening of new ports, which would be decided only
by the extent of the commercial development of
Manchuria.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c014'><sup>[477]</sup></a> On the next day, or, as the late Sir
M. Herbert rather inaccurately wrote to Lord Lansdowne,
“two days after the Russian Government
had categorically denied that the demands had been
made,” M. Plançon reiterated to Prince Ching, not
three, but all, of the seven conditions, and, consequently,
the Chinese treaty commissioners at Shanghai
were instructed, for the present, to refuse to
their American colleagues the opening of treaty
ports in Manchuria, which the latter had been demanding.
The United States Government, however,
taking little heed of M. Cassini’s argument,
instructed its commissioners at Shanghai, on the
strength of Count Lamsdorff’s denial, to insist upon
the opening of new Manchurian ports.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c014'><sup>[478]</sup></a> Against
this demand, M. Plançon seems to have renewed
his pressure upon the Chinese Government several
times during May,<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c014'><sup>[479]</sup></a> saying that he had received no
instructions from St. Petersburg to revoke his opposition.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c014'><sup>[480]</sup></a>
At last, Secretary Hay instructed Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Conger to suggest to M. Lessar, on the latter’s arrival
at Peking, that a simultaneous communication
should be made by them to the Peking Foreign
Office to the effect that the Russian Government
had, as Count Lamsdorff had said, no objection to
the opening of the treaty ports.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c014'><sup>[481]</sup></a> The Russian
Minister returned to Peking toward the end of
May, and telegraphed to his Government the suggestion
made by the American Government.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c014'><sup>[482]</sup></a> He,
as well as M. Cassini, renewed the assurance that
Russia was not opposed to the opening of the ports,
and Mr. MacCormick, who returned on leave to
Washington, confirmed the assurance.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c014'><sup>[483]</sup></a> Secretary
Hay now hoped that the only possible opposition
to be met would come from none but the Chinese
Government, and requested the support in the
matter<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c014'><sup>[484]</sup></a> of the British and Japanese Ministers at
Peking, which was willingly given. So late as on
June 5, however, M. Cassini addressed a note to
Mr. Hay, inquiring what was the meaning attached
by the United States Government to the term
“treaty port,” and what action it wished Russia to
take. Mr. Hay could only refer, in answer to the
first query, to the correspondence which passed
between the Russian and the United States Governments
in 1899,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c014'><sup>[485]</sup></a> and request, in reply to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>second, that Russia should inform China that it
was untrue that the former was, as had been stated
by China, preventing the opening of the treaty
ports.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c014'><sup>[486]</sup></a> Secretary Hay was so urgent about this
matter that he considered it indifferent whether the
opening was granted in a treaty or, as a compromise,
by a special Imperial edict.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c014'><sup>[487]</sup></a> M. Lessar had
the first interview after his return with Prince
Ching on June 10,<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c014'><sup>[488]</sup></a> and, according to the Japanese
press, renewed the original seven conditions,<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c014'><sup>[489]</sup></a>
including the refusal of ports. The Prince was
believed to have refused to discuss any of the conditions
except those regarding the establishment
of a sanitary board and the payment of customs
duties into the Russo-Chinese Bank at Niu-chwang,
which might be reconsidered. The Prince was then
granted another five days’ sick leave, returned to
the summer palace, and declined to see any foreign
Minister.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c014'><sup>[490]</sup></a> Rumors were then afloat which would
have one believe that the Prince, in spite of the
earnest protests of the British and Japanese Representatives,
was gradually yielding to Russian influence.
It is at least significant that at this critical
point he informed Mr. Townley, the British
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i>, on June 19, that an agreement
would soon be arrived at with Russia whereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Manchuria would be preserved to China without
any loss of sovereign rights. He added that China
would open treaty ports in Manchuria, if she saw
fit, after the Russian evacuation.<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c014'><sup>[491]</sup></a> The significance
of these remarks could easily be read between
the lines. Not only was the Russian evacuation
uncertain, but also it was no less patent to Russia
than to China that, in the marts, the opening of
which was under discussion, namely, Mukden and
perhaps Harbin, as well as An-tung and Tatung-kao
near the Korean boundary, the immediate
trade prospects were not considered so great as the
political danger which their opening might to some
degree avert. Had the evacuation been certain, and
had the commercial consideration been the sole
question involved, it would have been unnecessary
either to hasten their opening or even to select those
very places. Nor would MM. Cassini, Lessar, and
Plançon have been so strongly opposed to the proposition.
Seen in the light of these considerations,
Prince Ching’s new position appeared plainly to indicate
the gaining of Russian influence upon the
helpless Foreign Office of Peking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor for two years and a half since the first
agreement was reported to have been concluded between
Admiral Alexieff and Tartar General Tsêng-chi,
had the Manchuria question vexed the world.
If the question had concerned none but Russia and
China, and the former had been slow to promise
and loyal to her pledges and the latter strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>enough to guard her own interest, the uncertain
conditions in Manchuria would not have constituted,
as they did, a grave and continual menace to the
general peace of the Far East. Unfortunately, the
Russian pledges, on the one hand, were attended by
serious conditions, some of which it seemed impossible
to fulfill and others contrary to the recognized
principles of international intercourse to which
Russia had professed constant devotion, and, on the
other, China had again and again shown herself
impotent to resist what she would otherwise reject.
Above all, Great Britain and the United States were,
both from interest and from principle, firmly committed
in the East to a policy which was in constant
danger of being undermined by the conduct of
Russia. For Japan, however, the Manchurian question
possessed an even graver significance, for, with
the fall of the Three Eastern Provinces into the
Russian hands, the independence of Korea, as well
as the security of Japan herself, would be threatened,
while a consequent closure of Manchuria against
Japan’s economic activity would seriously maim her
growth and life as a nation. It was now considered,
therefore, that the irritating situation should no
longer be allowed to continue, and that the time
had at last come when Japan should with determination
deal <em>directly</em> with Russia, in order to effect
once for all an arrangement satisfactory and beneficial
to all the parties concerned and to the world at
large.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>DIPLOMATIC STRUGGLE IN KOREA, I</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Manchuria, however, constituted only one half—perhaps
the less important half—of the great
Eastern problem which perplexed the world and imperiled
the future life of Japan. In the other half,
namely, Korea, Japan was confronted by a situation
similar and closely allied to that in Manchuria, and
more directly menacing to herself. Let us briefly
describe the evolution of the complex Korean question
which ensued upon the Chinese-Japanese war
of 1894–5.</p>

<p class='c007'>The war had arisen from the conflicting wishes
of the belligerent Powers regarding Korea, China
asserting suzerain rights over the Peninsular Kingdom,
and the interests of Japan making its effective
independence imperative. Unfortunately, Korea’s
lack of material strength rendered her real independence
impossible, and her strength could be secured,
from the Japanese point of view, only by a thoroughgoing
reform of her administrative, financial, and
economic system, which had sunk into a state of unspeakable
corruption and decay. By her victory, the
colossal task devolved upon Japan of reforming the
national institutions of a people whose political training
in the past seemed to have made them particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>impervious to such an effort. Perhaps no work
more delicate and more liable to blunder and misunderstanding
could befall a nation than that of
setting another nation’s house in order who would
not feel its necessity. In this difficult enterprise,
the Japanese showed themselves as inexperienced as
the Koreans were reluctant and resentful. Three
million <em>yen</em> were furnished by Japan to Korea in
the interest of various reforms, as also were numerous
councilors, including such able men as Shūichirō
Saitō and the late Tōru Hoshi. Some of the
others, however, were either inferior in attainments
or impatient of slow processes. The entire movement
was intrusted to the direction of the new
Japanese Minister, Count K. Inoüé, a generous,
brilliant, and bold statesman. He presented to the
Korean sovereign a plan of reform, which included
the proposal to remove from her share of political
control the versatile Queen, whose family of the
Min had grown powerful by means of the abuses
which the Count wished to eradicate. In this attempt,
in which he was largely successful, of drawing
a line of demarcation between the Court and
the Government, he inevitably incurred the deep
ire of the family whose influence had been predominant
both at the capital and in the country. Other
measures of his reform further antagonized the official
nobility of the Kingdom.<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c014'><sup>[492]</sup></a> The influence of
the Count, however, was so great, and the training
of Korean troops by Japanese officers seemed so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>successful, that even the domineering Queen was
obliged to await a more favorable moment to regain
her lost prestige.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time Russia was represented at Seul by
M. Waeber, who had been in Korea for more than
ten years, and whose personality and diplomatic
arts had won him warm friends in the Court, particularly
the Queen and her party. At one time,
before the late war, when the ascendency of the
Chinese Resident, Yuan Shi-kai, had created disaffection
among certain Koreans, M. Waeber was said
to have succeeded in quietly allying himself with
those people and promoting Russian influence over
them.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c014'><sup>[493]</sup></a> It was now again found possible for him
and his talented wife to recommend themselves to
the large body of men and women whose feeling
the Japanese had in one way or another alienated,
and slowly but surely to undermine the latter’s influence
in Seul.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c014'><sup>[494]</sup></a> The successful coercion of Japan
by the three Powers after the treaty of Shimonoseki
must also have gone far toward reducing the
prestige of Japan in the eye of the Koreans, who
are singularly susceptible to the influence of events
of this nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Count Inoüé left Seul, the Queen
again came to the front. On July 7, 1895, she
suddenly accused of treason the most influential
member of the Cabinet and chief of the pro-Japanese
party, Pak Yong-hio, who again had to flee to
Japan, where he had recently spent ten years of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>refugee’s life.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c014'><sup>[495]</sup></a> Count Inoüé returned to Seul, and
again the Queen held her breath. A Cabinet was
organized of partisans of reform. The Count was,
however, relieved of his post late in July, and in
September was succeeded as the Japanese Minister
by Viscount Lieutenant-General Gorō Miura, a
man of undoubted sincerity, but utterly without
diplomatic training. No sooner had Inoüé left
Korea than the Queen reasserted herself, increased
the personnel of her household, and restored many
of her old extravagances so lately removed by the
reformer. She had been further embittered by
the sharp rivalry shown against her and the Min by
the King’s father, Tai-wen-kun, and his party. The
Queen finally planned a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</span></i>, early in October,
with a view to disbanding the soldiers trained
by Japanese officers and replacing the progressive
Cabinet members with her friends. A crisis was
imminent, and it was at this juncture that some
of the Japanese in Seul betrayed themselves into
a crime which caused a bitter disappointment and
lasting disgrace to the Government and the nation
at home. Perceiving that a passive attitude would
result in a great calamity, certain Koreans and
Japanese rose early on October 8, to bring Tai-wen-kun
out of his secluded residence. Accompanied by
two battalions of trained soldiers, the veteran statesman
rode toward the King’s palace, where he was
to present a plan of reform, but was opposed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>guard, who fired at his escort. In the midst of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</span> which ensued, some of the bravoes rushed
into the Inner Palace and murdered the Queen.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c014'><sup>[496]</sup></a>
The deed was no less crushing a blow to the Japanese
nation than it was to the bereaved King of
Korea, for the former’s ardent desire always to
adhere to the fairest principles of international conduct
was, for once, frustrated by the rash act of a
handful of their brethren at Seul. The pernicious
influence of the Queen passed away, and the power
of the reform Cabinet was for the moment assured,
but only at the expense of a revolting crime which
the Japanese will never cease to lament. It is probable
that the murder of the Queen, as apart from
the rise of Tai-wen-kun, was premeditated, and also
that Minister Miura had been prevailed upon to
connive at the guilt. The Japanese Government at
once recalled and tried him and forty-seven other
suspected persons, and prohibited Japanese from
visiting Korea without special permission.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. (now Baron) Komura, who presently succeeded
to the Ministry at Seul, seemed to reverse
the policy of his predecessors and abstain from
active interference. The Korean Cabinet also appeared
powerless to check the Russian party, whose
power was growing apace. Prominent politicians
out of office frequently conferred at the Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Legation, where some of them were even said to
have taken refuge from the law. There a leader of
this party (who till May of the present year represented
Korea at St. Petersburg) matured a plan to
overthrow the Cabinet, or, in case of failure, to abduct
the King and the Crown Prince to Vladivostok.
The plan, however, was discovered on November
28,<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c014'><sup>[497]</sup></a> only to be followed by another, which proved
successful. In January, 1896, there took place a
slight uprising in Northern Korea, at the instigation,
it was said, of pro-Russian leaders. When the
major portion of the army had been sent out of
the capital to suppress the alleged rebellion, 127
Russian marines with a cannon suddenly landed at
Chemulpo on February 10, and immediately entered
Seul. The next day, before dawn, the King, with
the seal of the state, as well as the Crown Prince
and Princess and some court ladies, fled in disguise
to the Russian Legation, where the King remained
for a twelvemonth, till February 20 of the following
year. At his arrival at the Legation, an edict
was issued proclaiming the Cabinet Ministers guilty
of treason, and ordering their decapitation. Another
edict canceling the order appeared too late,
for the Prime Minister and two other Ministers had
been murdered on the streets in broad daylight,
and their heads exposed by the wayside, while
three others had fled to Japan for life.<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c014'><sup>[498]</sup></a> The murders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of February, 1896, would have come down to
history as more atrocious than the crime of October
8, 1895, had it not been for the fact that the latter
involved the life of a queen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The King being virtually in the custody of the
Russians, their ascendency resulted as a matter of
course. They secured, among other things, an immense
timber concession on the northern frontier
and on Uinung Island,<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c014'><sup>[499]</sup></a> and a mining concession
along the Tumên River.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c014'><sup>[500]</sup></a> The Korean forces trained
by Japanese officers were abolished in May,<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c014'><sup>[501]</sup></a> and the
Japanese soldiers stationed at the ports and Seul
also were reduced in number.<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c014'><sup>[502]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Government at Tokio even appeared, for a
time at least, to forsake its historic policy of safe-guarding
Korea’s independence by its sole aid, but
to seek Russia’s coöperation toward the same end.
With this object in view, Japan seized the occasion
of the coronation of the Czar to send Field
Marshal Marquis Aritomo Yamagata<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c014'><sup>[503]</sup></a> as special
envoy to St. Petersburg, with a commission to
negotiate with the Russian Government an agreement
regarding the relative position of the two
Powers in Korea. The result was the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Yamagata-Lobanoff Protocol, signed on June 9,
1896:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article I.</span> The Japanese and Russian Governments
should, with the object of remedying the financial
embarrassments of Korea, counsel the Korean Government
to suppress all unnecessary expenses and to establish
an equilibrium between expenditure and revenue.
If, as a result of the reforms which should be considered
indispensable, it should become necessary to have recourse
to foreign debts, the two Governments should, of
a common accord, render their support to Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article II.</span> The Japanese and Russian Governments
should try to abandon to Korea, in so far as the
financial and economic situation of that country should
permit, the creation and the maintenance of an armed
force and of a police organized of native subjects, in proportions
sufficient to maintain internal order, without
foreign aid.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article III.</span> With a view to facilitating communications
with Korea, the Japanese Government shall continue
to administer the telegraphic lines which are actually
in its possession.</p>

<p class='c032'>“It is reserved to Russia to establish a telegraphic line
from Seul to her frontier.</p>

<p class='c032'>“These various lines should be purchased by the
Korean Government, as soon as it finds means so to do.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article IV.</span> In case the principles above expounded
require a more precise and more detailed definition, or if
in the future other points should arise about which it
should be necessary to consult, the Representatives of the
two Governments should be instructed to discuss them
amicably.”<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c014'><sup>[504]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>A few days earlier, on May 14, there was concluded
at Seul between M. Komura and M. Waeber,
the Japanese and Russian Ministers, a Memorandum
dealing with matters of more immediate interest
to the two Powers.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c014'><sup>[505]</sup></a> M. Waeber agreed to advise
the Korean King to return from the Russian Legation
to his palace, as soon as there was no more
apprehension for his safety, M. Komura pledging
in return to keep the Japanese political bravoes
(<em>sō-shi</em>) in Seul under a strict surveillance (Article
I.). It was declared that the present Cabinet members<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c014'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
of Korea were noted for generous and mild
principles, and had been appointed to their posts
by the King of his own accord. The Japanese and
Russian Representatives should always make it their
aim to advise the King to govern his people in
generous spirit (Article II.). The remainder of the
Memorandum is more worthy of record:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article III.</span> The Representative of Russia quite
agrees with the Representative of Japan that, at the
present state of affairs in Korea, it may be necessary to
have the Japanese guards stationed at some places for
the protection of the Japanese telegraph line between
Fusan and Seul, and that these guards, now consisting of
three companies of soldiers, should be withdrawn as soon
as possible and replaced by gendarmes, who will be stationed
as follows: fifty men at Tai-ku, fifty men at Ka-heung,
and ten men each at ten intermediate posts between
Fusan and Seul. This distribution may be liable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to some changes, but the total number of gendarme force
shall never exceed 200 men, who will afterwards be
gradually withdrawn from those places in which peace
and order have been restored by the Korean Government.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c014'><sup>[507]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article IV.</span> For the protection of the Japanese
settlements at Seul and the open ports against the possible
attacks by the Korean populace, two companies of
Japanese troops may be stationed at Seul, one company
at Fusan and one at Gensan, each company not to exceed
200 men. These troops shall be quartered near the
settlements, and should be withdrawn as soon as no apprehensions
of such attacks could be entertained.</p>

<p class='c032'>“For the protection of the Russian Legation and Consulates,
the Russian Government may also keep guards
not exceeding in number the Japanese troops at these
places, which will be withdrawn as soon as tranquillity
in the interior is completely restored.”<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c014'><sup>[508]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A casual reading of these agreements will show
how far the Japanese Government had receded from
the position she originally took in regard to Korea.
Ever since Japan concluded her treaty with Korea
in 1876,<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c014'><sup>[509]</sup></a> which for the first time established the
international position of the latter State as a sovereign
Power, Japan’s policy had been to uphold
the independence and the opening of the Peninsular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Kingdom. From the strict terms of this policy,
Japan has allowed herself to depart twice,—in her
agreements, first, with China in 1885, and, again,
with Russia in 1896,—not by forsaking its principles,
but in each case by entering, in the pursuit
of the policy, into an impossible association with an
aggressive Power. In each of the two instances the
attempt failed within a decade, and resulted in hostilities.
In 1885, Japan and China simultaneously
withdrew their forces from Korea, and thereby
cleared the ground for the renewed conflict of their
opposing interests, which were artificially placed
on a par with one another. In 1896, Japan admitted
Russia’s right to build a telegraph line in
North Korea which should correspond to the Japanese
line in the south, and to station in Korea a
number of troops equal to that of the Japanese
soldiers. Despite the millenniums of her historic
relations with Korea, and the actual preponderance
of her interests therein, and after her successful
liberation of the Kingdom from Chinese suzerainty
by a costly war, Japan, now admitted into the Peninsular
politics on an equal footing with herself a
Power which owed its bright success to a mere diplomacy
of less than two years’ standing, and whose
policy seemed to be guided by principles entirely at
variance with the independence and strength of
Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the coronation of the Czar, Korea was represented
by an influential, pro-Russian member of the
Min family. It was then rumored that he concluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>with the Russian Government a secret agreement
by which Korea undertook to employ Russian military
instructors and financial councilors. However
that may be, the Russian Representatives at Seul
are said to have since appealed more than once to
the “secret agreement” in their attempts to force
the engagement of Russian service upon the Korean
Government.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c014'><sup>[510]</sup></a> If these reports were true, no better
proof of the light estimate with which Russia
from the first regarded the Yamagata-Lobanoff
Protocol could be found than her alleged agreement
with Min Yong-hwan, for the latter was a direct
reversal of the first two Articles of the former.
Russia may be credited with having succeeded, by
her separate and mutually contradictory arrangements
with Min, Yamagata, and Li Hung-chang,<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c014'><sup>[511]</sup></a> in
simultaneously bringing the three Eastern Powers
to terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever the truth of the reported Russo-Korean
Agreement, Russia did no sooner sign her
Japanese Protocol of June 9, than she began to
violate its terms. In the same month, it was resolved
that Korean troops should henceforth be
instructed under the Russian system of military
education, and accordingly, in October, three army
officers, a medical officer, and ten soldiers from
Russia arrived at Seul. In April, 1897, M. Waeber
was urging upon the Seul Government the employment
of 160 officers and soldiers, and, despite the
reluctance of Korea and inquiries from Japan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>three Russian officers and ten soldiers entered the
capital in July, whose service for three years was
finally, on September 6, imposed upon the Korean
Government by M. A. de Speyer, the new Russian
Minister. Thus the royal guard and five battalions
of the Korean infantry, numbering about 3000,
came under Russian instruction.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c014'><sup>[512]</sup></a> A month later,
M. Speyer requested that the control of all the
receipts from the taxes and customs be placed in
the hands of one M. Kir Alexieff. At that time,
however, a British subject, Mr. MacLeavy Brown,
had not served his term as Financial Adviser and
General Director of Customs of Korea. Failing
the assent of the Finance Department, M. Speyer
pressed upon the Foreign Department, which yielded
at last. The British Consul, Mr. Jordan, protested
in vain, for, on October 26, the Korean King issued
an edict releasing Mr. Brown from his duties. A
Russo-Korean Bank was soon organized to transact
the financial and economical affairs of Korea.
On December 27, seven British men-of-war visited
Chemulpo, and Mr. Jordan went thither, returning
to Seul accompanied by a naval officer and ten
marines. Mr. Brown was consequently restored to
his office, and M. Alexieff had to content himself
with a subordinate position under him.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c014'><sup>[513]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was a misfortune to Russia that her able representative
at Seul, M. Waeber, who had been in
Korea since 1884, had been transferred to Mexico,
and was replaced by M. Speyer. The former diplomat’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>pleasing manners were succeeded by the latter’s
overbearing conduct, which appeared gradually
to alienate from Russian influence many a former
friend of M. Waeber. The anti-Russian sentiment
grew finally so strong that a large number of intelligent
Koreans organized the Korean Independence
Society, whose object was declared to be to restore
the military, financial, and political control of the
Kingdom to the hands of the Koreans. The impatient
M. Speyer was reported to have written a note
to the Korean Government, on March 7, 1898,
asking for a reply within twenty-four hours to the
query whether Korea was really in want of the service
of the Russian experts, whose position had become
rather precarious. The astounded Government
replied politely but firmly in the negative. Other
events occurred which further evinced the arbitrary
attitude of M. Speyer. With an equally astonishing
decision, he ordered, on March 17, all the financial
and military councilors to be recalled to Russia.
The Russo-Korean Bank was also disorganized.
M. Speyer himself leaving Korea in April, his post
was occupied by the amiable M. Matunine.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c014'><sup>[514]</sup></a> About
this time, a new Russo-Japanese Protocol was signed
at Tokio between Baron Rosen, the Russian Minister
to Japan, and Baron Nishi, the Foreign Minister
of the Japanese Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that the relaxation of Russia’s diplomacy
in Korea was in no small measure due to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>the swift movement of events, as well as her own
all-engrossing activity, in China. The Nishi-Rosen
Protocol of April 25, 1898, concluded as it was at
this unfavorable moment for Russia, was far more
in Japan’s favor than the agreements of 1896. It
not only gave an explicit recognition of the independence
of Korea, but also incorporated in the
second Article the best principles of the previous
agreement, and, in addition, fully recognized the
special economic interests of Japan in the Peninsula.
The entire Protocol deserves quotation:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article I.</span> The Imperial Governments of Japan and
Russia definitely recognize the independence and the
perfect sovereignty of Korea, and mutually engage to
abstain from all direct interference in the internal affairs
of that country.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article II.</span> Desirous of removing all possible causes
of misunderstanding in the future, the Imperial Governments
of Japan and Russia mutually engage, in case
Korea should have recourse to the counsel and assistance
of either Japan or Russia, not to take any measure
regarding the nomination of military instructors and financial
advisers, without having previously arrived at a mutual
accord on the subject.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article III.</span> In view of the great development of
the commercial and industrial enterprises of Japan in
Korea, as also of the considerable number of the Japanese
subjects residing in that country, the Russian Imperial
Government shall not obstruct the development of the
commercial and industrial relations between Japan and
Korea.”<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c014'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Each one of these three Articles should be carefully
noted, for five years later, in 1903, they,
together with the last Article of the Yamagata-Lobanoff
Protocol of June 9, 1896, became a conventional
ground for Japan’s direct negotiations
with Russia which preceded the present war. Particular
attention is called to the third Article,
wherein Russia recognized for the first time the
peculiar interest of the Japanese nation in the economic
development of Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Less artificial as the Protocol was in comparison
with the former agreements, it was, however, hardly
adequate as an instrument to reconcile the conflicting
interests of Russia and Japan. Fresh complications
could well be expected from the second
Article, for it, on the other hand, barred the reformatory
attempts of a Power whose interests demanded
the independence and strength of Korea, and,
on the other, cleared the ground for the renewed
activity of another Power which had little intention
to abstain from undermining the vital interests of
Japan. Under these precarious circumstances was
opened the second period of the Russo-Japanese
relations in Korea.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <span class='large'>DIPLOMATIC STRUGGLE IN KOREA, II</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>From 1899, both Japan and Russia were represented
at Seul by new Ministers, Mr. G. Hayashi
and M. Paul Pavloff. The latter had been the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> at Peking, where he had recently made a
brilliant success in securing for Russia a lease of
Port Arthur and Talien-wan, and the right to connect
these ports by rail with the great Siberian line.
The contrast of character between the bold and
ambitious Pavloff and the slow, tenacious Hayashi
was an interesting index to the dramatic struggle
which ensued in Korea between the rival Powers.
For five years after the arrival of the diplomats,
the desires of Russia and Japan seemed to clash,
not only in Seul, but also in all directions within
the Peninsula. Nearly every move made by either
Power was countervailed by the other, Russia in
most cases being the prime mover and Japan closely
disputing the action of her rival. The feeble Government
of Korea was sorely vexed between the
vigorous demands and protests of the contending
Powers, while the flexible will of the Emperor<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c014'><sup>[516]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the discord and venality of his servants aggravated
the endless confusion of the situation. Let us now
briefly observe how this keen rivalry manifested
itself in the south, at the capital, and in the north
of Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>In South Korea, nothing better could be desired
by Russia than a lease of Masampo, a harbor unsurpassed
for its naval facilities and most admirably
situated as a connecting-point between Vladivostok
and Port Arthur. An opportunity came in
May, 1899, when Masampo, together with two other
ports, was opened for foreign trade, for the foreigner
is at liberty to purchase land within the
three-mile radius of an open port. In the same
month, M. Pavloff with the Military <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Attaché</span></i> visited
Masampo on his way home on a furlough, and was
met there by Admiral Makaroff, commander of the
Eastern squadron of the Russian navy, and, after
making an extended survey of the coast and the
harbor, selected the most strategic site on the foreshore,
which he earmarked by setting up posts at
its limits. This large lot, M. Pavloff notified the
local authorities, would presently be purchased by
a private Russian steamship company as the site
for a dock and coaling-sheds. It was not till July
that M. Stein, interpreter at the Russian Legation,
went to the port with a view to effecting the purchase
of the selected lot, which, to his chagrin, had
already been bought by certain Japanese subjects
from its legitimate owners. In vain the Russian
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> demanded the Seul Government to cancel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the contract and resell the land to the Russian
company, for, as the Government repeatedly explained,
the authorities had no right to interfere
with the alienation of private land by its owners
within the three-mile radius of any treaty port. As
unavailing was the request of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> upon Mr.
Hayashi to induce the buyers to relinquish even a
portion of the purchased lot. Then the local authorities
at Masampo were approached by the Russian
Representatives, and consequently the deed of
purchase was for a long time withheld by them,
though it was at length given to the new owners.
On September 14, M. Stein, now the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i>, notified
the Korean Government that, under the instructions
of the Russian Foreign Minister, he would be
obliged to take liberty of action in order to protect
Russian interest, if the Japanese contract was not
canceled; on October 4, again, he threatened that
a forcible seizure of land would result from the
non-compliance of the Korean Government. The
replies of the latter were unalterably firm in refusing
to annul a lawful transaction.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c014'><sup>[517]</sup></a> In the mean
time, Russian diplomatic agents, naval officers, and
engineers from Seul and Vladivostok were frequently
visiting Masampo, and buying from the
natives tracts of indifferent value.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c014'><sup>[518]</sup></a> In March, 1900,
M. Pavloff returned from his furlough, and demanded
the signature of the Masampo lease-contract
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>in quite indefinite terms which he had previously
framed. On March 16, Rear Admiral Hilidebrand
came to Chemulpo with several war-vessels,
and proceeded to Seul, where he was magnificently
received by M. Pavloff and had an audience with
the Emperor. Two days later, the lease agreement
was signed<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c014'><sup>[519]</sup></a> by the Korean Foreign Minister and
M. Pavloff, which, however, was of little practical
use so long as the most important tract had been
bought by the Japanese. On the same day, the
Minister secured from the Korean Government a
pledge not to alienate any part of the Kojedo Island
near Masampo and its surrounding territories, Russia
herself engaging not to seek such alienation on
her part.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c014'><sup>[520]</sup></a></p>

<div id='i_302'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_302.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>M. PAVLOFF<br /><br /><em>Late Russian Minister at Seul</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>No sooner did Russia appear to content herself
with these valueless formal pledges from Korea
than she again sought to acquire land round
Masampo. At the close of March, M. Pavloff had
almost succeeded in securing the purchase of
Nampo outside the three-mile limit of Masampo,
but the reminder of Mr. Hayashi, expressed through
the Foreign Office of Seul, that the foreigner was
not entitled to own land beyond the fixed radius
of a treaty port, produced its desired effect. Nampo
was forsaken, and another lot inside the three-mile
boundary was purchased by the Russians.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c014'><sup>[521]</sup></a> In May,
M. Pavloff wished to lease Tja-pok on the inner
shore of Masampo, but, finding again that a Japanese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>subject had already leased it, finally acquired
the lease of Pankumi upon the outer shore, for
the purpose of erecting a hospital, warehouses, and
a recreation ground, for the use of the Russian
navy.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c014'><sup>[522]</sup></a> This concession, however, has not been extensively
utilized by the Russians, owing probably
to the inferior site of Pankumi.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c014'><sup>[523]</sup></a> Mr. Hayashi met
the Russian concession by acquiring, between May
and October 29, 1901, about forty acres of land
within the treaty limits of Masampo as a settlement
for Japanese citizens.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c014'><sup>[524]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is needless to add that the firm attitude of the
Korean Government, which alone saved Masampo
from the fate of Port Arthur, was in the main due
to the persistent representations and support rendered
to Korea by Mr. Hayashi against Russian
encroachment. For if the control of Masampo was
a matter of supreme importance for the Russian
navy, Japan, on her part, could not for a moment
tolerate the presence, in the harbor so near to herself,
of a Power whose vast dominion was extending
eastward with tremendous pressure. Russia’s ill
success at Masampo, however, was not to mark the
end of her activity on the southern coast of Korea,
which contains a few other harbors only second
in importance to Masampo. In one of these, Chinhai
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Bay, M. Pavloff made, about March, 1901, an
unauthorized demand for a lease, which again was
refused.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c014'><sup>[525]</sup></a> From that time till the opening of the
Russo-Japanese negotiations in 1903, the Russian
Representative did not think the time opportune to
prefer further demands on this coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning now to the diplomacy at the Korean
capital, we observe that its first aim seems to have
been to repeat the old policy of replacing Mr. MacLeavy
Brown, a British subject, as the Director-General
of Korean Customs, with M. Kir Alexieff,
and also to put Korea under financial obligation to
Russia by means of a loan. In March, 1901, Mr.
Brown was suddenly ordered by the Korean Government,
which acted obviously at the instance of
the Russian Representative, to vacate his residence
and surrender his post. The British <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i>, Mr.
Gubbins, had barely succeeded in prevailing upon
the Korean Government to revoke the latter half of
the order, when in May another order was issued
calling for the delivery, not only of Mr. Brown’s
official residence, but also of the customs office
building—an order equivalent to a dismissal from
office. From this predicament Mr. Brown was narrowly
rescued by an earnest representation made on
May 5 by Mr. Hayashi to the Korean Emperor.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c014'><sup>[526]</sup></a> By
this time, the affair had been complicated by an
agreement of a 5,000,000 <em>yen</em> loan, which had been
signed on April 19, between the Korean Government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>and the French agent, M. Cazalis, of the Yunnan
Syndicate.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c014'><sup>[527]</sup></a> It is hardly necessary to give the
detail of this abortive agreement, for it was never
ratified by the Emperor, but fell through from the
inability of the Syndicate to fulfill its terms.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c014'><sup>[528]</sup></a> It is
only necessary to say that if the loan had materialized,
a large control over the coinage, mining, and
general finances of Korea would have passed into the
hands of the French subjects and perhaps also of the
Russo-Chinese Bank. This Bank, in the latter half
of 1902, seems to have offered a fresh loan through
its agents at Seul, Gunzburg and Company, under
the condition that the firm should obtain a permanent
monopoly of ginseng, which had then been in
the hands of the Japanese, and also the right of
working certain mines.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c014'><sup>[529]</sup></a> This proposition also miscarried,
evidently owing to the protest from the
Japanese Minister, who discovered in it a violation
of the first Article of the Yamagata-Lobanoff Protocol
of June 9, 1896. A Belgian loan, which was
rumored early in 1903, seems to have shared the
same fate with all the loans previously suggested.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c014'><sup>[530]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection, it should be noted, in justice
to all the parties concerned, that toward the latter
half of 1900 there was a movement in Japan to suggest
a loan to the Korean Government, but that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Premier, Marquis Yamagata, declined to countenance
the scheme.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c014'><sup>[531]</sup></a> He probably did not wish his
nation to become a party to a violation of an agreement
it made with Russia in 1896.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1902–3, the interest of Russia was represented
at Seul, not only by her regular Representative, but
also by Baron Gunzburg, who served as an agent
for many an economic enterprise in Korea proposed
by the Russians, by an Alsatian lady, Mlle. Sonntag,
a relative of Mme. Waeber and an influential
member of the court circle, and, temporarily,
by M. Waeber himself,<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c014'><sup>[532]</sup></a> who had come to Seul as
special envoy of the Czar to attend the fortieth anniversary
of the accession of the Korean Sovereign
to the throne.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c014'><sup>[533]</sup></a> These persons were further supported
by a few Koreans who had lived in Siberia
and adopted Russian citizenship, and whose rapid
promotion in office had excited jealousy among the
nobility in Seul.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c014'><sup>[534]</sup></a> Among the latter, also, there were
Russian sympathizers of the greatest political influence.
Taking advantage of the continual discord
among the politicians in Seul, which at that time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>manifested itself in the rancorous hatred between
the supporters of the Crown Prince and those of
Lady Öm, who aspired to the position of the Queen,
the Russians succeeded in enlisting the good-will
of the leaders of both parties, Yi Yong-ik and Yi-Keun-thaik.
Once a lad of mean birth in the
north,<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c014'><sup>[535]</sup></a> Yi Yong-ik, by his unscrupulous methods,
had amassed a large fortune and risen to the Ministry
of the Imperial Household, until, in November,
1902, he found himself the object of a sharp opposition
by Yi Keun-thaik and a large section of the
gentry of Seul. He at once took refuge in the Russian
Legation, and was then taken on board the
“Korietz” to Port Arthur, where he used his seal
of the Imperial Estates Board and transacted his
official business as before.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c014'><sup>[536]</sup></a> On January 13, 1903,
he returned to Seul, and used his influence to further
the already started obstruction to the bank-notes
issued by the Korean branch of the First Bank
of Japan. These notes had first appeared in May,
1902, and, beside the deplorable monetary system
of Korea, met so great a demand from the commercial
world that, by the end of the year, the amount
issued had risen nearly to 1,000,000 <em>yen</em> against a
reserve only a little below that sum.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c014'><sup>[537]</sup></a> Suddenly, at
the instance of the Russians who wished to issue
similar notes from the Russo-Chinese Bank, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>Korean Government had prohibited the circulation
of the Japanese notes in December, 1902. The
credit of the notes and the benefit of their use had
been so obvious, however, that, in spite of the Government
order, the Director-General of the Customs
had still received payments in them, and the Chinese
Minister had advised his countrymen to continue
their use. The veto had then been removed, only to
be renewed at the return of Yi Yong-ik from Port
Arthur. He had entertained the desire, which has
been found utterly impracticable, of himself establishing
a central bank and issuing paper notes.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c014'><sup>[538]</sup></a> He
employed all the means at his disposal to resist the
opposition of the Japanese Representative, who was
now supported by his British colleague, Mr. Jordan.
The bank-notes were not reinstated till February
13, 1903, when a compromise was at last reached
with the Korean Government.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c014'><sup>[539]</sup></a> It is impossible to
establish the complicity of the Russian diplomats in
Yi Yong-ik’s obstruction, which thus ended in failure,
beyond the fact that the Korean politician had
been in close touch with the Muscovites. From the
historical point of view, Russia could hardly have
interfered with the issue of the Japanese bank-notes
without transgressing the third Article of the Nishi-Rosen
Protocol of April 25, 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far we have related the comparative failure
of Russia’s diplomacy in South Korea and at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>capital. In the north, however, which was conterminous
with her dominion and with Manchuria,
Russia achieved a greater success. On March 29,
1899,<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c014'><sup>[540]</sup></a> M. Pavloff succeeded, after his earlier and
much larger demands had failed, in leasing for
twelve years, for the use of Count H. Keyserling,
a Russian subject, three whaling stations<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c014'><sup>[541]</sup></a> on the
northeastern coast, each 700 by 350 feet in extent.
This concession was offset by one secured by
a Japanese citizen, on February 14, 1900,<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c014'><sup>[542]</sup></a> which
conferred upon him the right of whaling for three
years, subject to renewal, along the Korean coast,
excepting the waters for the distance of three <em>li</em>
adjoining the three provinces on which the Keyserling
concessions were situated and the Province
of Chul-la.</p>

<p class='c007'>Farther north, upon the frontier, the long boundary
line naturally divides itself into two parts,
namely, the Tumên River, separating Korea from
Primorsk of Siberia and the Kirin Province of Manchuria,
and the Yalu River, which borders upon the
strategically most important Province of Sheng-king
of South Manchuria. Along the former stream,
Russia acquired by a treaty of 1884<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c014'><sup>[543]</sup></a> the opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>of the port of Kiong-hung to the Russian land
trade, and a free navigation of the Tumên. A
dozen years later,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c014'><sup>[544]</sup></a> when the Sovereign sojourned
at the Russian Legation, the Muscovites concluded
an agreement with the Seul Government whereby
they were granted the privilege of mining gold and
other minerals for fifteen years, and coal for twenty
years, in two districts near Kiong-hung, as well as
the right to construct a railway or carriage-road
from the mines to the shore. It has often been reported
that the poverty-stricken people as well as
the venal officers along the river have continually
mortgaged their property to the Russians, who thus
have acquired extensive tracts of land, circulated
Russian coins among the natives, and otherwise implanted
their influence far and wide. Then early
in 1902, M. Pavloff sought to make a step in advance
in this direction, when, without permission
from Korea, a telegraph line was extended from
Possiet to Kiong-hung across the Tumên River.
He desired that the Seul Government should recognize
the accomplished fact, and Rear Admiral
Skrydloff, commanding the Pacific squadron of the
Russian navy, visited the capital on February 17,
and intimated his hope that the question would be
amicably settled. The Foreign Minister, Pak Che-sun,
however, successfully ordered on February 22
that the telegraph line so surreptitiously built be
removed. In the mean while, it was discovered that
the St. Petersburg Government had had nothing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>do with the building of the line which had recently
been removed. M. Pavloff, however, succeeded in
securing the dismissal of Pak from his post. He also
persisted in demanding the right of the Russians to
reconstruct the line across the Tumên River. He
was as much justified in preferring such a demand,
as was the Korean Government in refusing to accede
to it. The latter was probably apprehensive
that its concession to Russia would be followed by
similar demands from other Powers. At present,
the Korean telegraph line reaches from Seul to
Kion-song, some forty miles from Kiong-hung.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c014'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the Yalu River, also, M. Pavloff desired a telegraphic
connection with Wiju from Port Arthur
and from Harbin, which, after a failure in May,
1902, was at last granted in April, 1903.<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c014'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>More important, however, is the question of the
Seul-Wiju Railway, which had been the bone of contention
between Japan and the allied Powers of
Russia and France, until the outbreak of the present
war suddenly changed the situation in favor of the
former. By the temporary articles of August 20,
1894,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c014'><sup>[547]</sup></a> Korea had granted a prior right to the Japanese
Government or companies to construct railways
between Seul and Fusan. The actual undertaking,
however, was so delayed, that, on March 29, 1896,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c014'><sup>[548]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Mr. James R. Morse, an American citizen, succeeded
in acquiring the Seul-Chemulpo concession, and began
to build the line. In October, 1898, Mr. Morse
sold the concession to certain Japanese capitalists,
and the line, which was the first railway owned
abroad by Japanese subjects, has been in running
order since July, 1900. The contract for the other
line—Fusan-Seul—was not made by the Japanese
till September 8, 1898.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c014'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Prior to this, on July 3,
1896,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c014'><sup>[550]</sup></a> a French company had acquired a grant to
connect Seul with Wiju on the Yalu by rail. Finding,
however, little prospect of starting the work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>within the specified period of three years, the company
tried to sell the concession, first to the Russian
Government and then to Japan, but neither was prepared
to accept the proposed terms. About 1900,
Yi Yong-ik instituted in the Imperial Household
Department the Northwestern Railway Bureau, over
which he presided, with the express purpose of
building the line with Korean capital. The French
Minister at Seul, however, had a short time before
obtained exclusive right to furnish material and
engineers for the building of the line, so that Korean
money and French skill were to be enlisted for
the service.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c014'><sup>[551]</sup></a> After a long delay, President Yi held
a great undertaking ceremony on May 8, 1902, but
it was patent to every one that no Korean capital
was forthcoming. As was expected, not a mile of
rail having been laid, the work was suspended in
June, and indefinitely postponed.<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c014'><sup>[552]</sup></a> Considering,
however, that a Seul-Wiju line would naturally pass
through the gold mines of Yun-san and Yin-san and
the coal region of Ping-yang, and the great agricultural
province of Hwang-hai, as well as such commercial
centres as Kai-song, Ping-yang, Hwang-ju,
and An-ju, the advantages of controlling this line
appeared too great for the competing foreigners
to leave its construction to the care of the impecunious
Korean Government. Particularly jealous
were the Russians of the line passing into the hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>of their political rivals, for then—if, furthermore,
a railway connection were effected by the same
rivals between Wiju and Niu-chwang—the deep-laid
design of Russia to make Dalny the great trading
port for Manchuria and North China would be
seriously upset by the railway reaching directly from
the producing centres of these regions and Korea
to the port of Fusan, whence a ready communication
oversea might well radiate toward Japan, Europe,
and America. It was natural, therefore, for M.
Stein, Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i>, again to recommend,
as he did on February 15, 1903, the honest
Baron Gunzburg to the Korean Government, and
to demand of the latter on behalf of the Baron the
right of laying the Seul-Wiju Railway. The Government,
however, declined<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c014'><sup>[553]</sup></a> to entertain the application,
as it was its intention to complete the line on its
own resources, and not to concede it to any foreign
Power.<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c014'><sup>[554]</sup></a> Later, another attempt was made in August
by the Seul Government to reopen the work of construction,
for which a French syndicate represented
by M. Rondon was to supply all machinery,<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c014'><sup>[555]</sup></a> but,
again, the lack of funds frustrated the attempt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Since that time, no important development of this
question had transpired before the beginning of hostilities
between Russia and Japan.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have so far seen enough of Korean diplomacy
to comprehend something of the Russian
method of furthering her influence over Korea, and
of the manner in which Japan struggled to safeguard
her fast increasing interests<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c014'><sup>[556]</sup></a> in the peninsula
and to maintain the terms of the Russian
agreements of 1896 and 1898. We have, however,
reserved up to this point the latest and most important
question of the timber concession upon the
northern frontier. In no other matter had the
characteristic method of Russian diplomacy excited
more apprehension in Korea and Japan, for nothing
could better illustrate the close connection, in the
Muscovite policy, of Manchuria and North Korea—a
connection which appeared to threaten at once
the integrity of the two adjoining Empires and the
safety of Japan—than the Yong-am-po incident
which arose in April, 1903, in relation to the timber
concession. The contract<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c014'><sup>[557]</sup></a> for this concession
dated so far back as August 28, 1896, when the
Korean King was a guest at the Russian Legation.
It had secured for a Russian merchant at Vladivostok
the right to organize a Korean lumber company
(Article 1), having a monopoly for twenty years of
the forestry enterprise round the Mu-san region upon
the Tumên River and also on the Uinung Island in
Japan Sea (Article 2). The work, in order to be valid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>had to be begun within one year after the signature
of the agreement (Article 15). Only when work in
these two regions should have been under way, the
company might, within five years<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c014'><sup>[558]</sup></a> from the same
date, start a similar exploitation along the Yalu
River (Article 2).<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c014'><sup>[559]</sup></a> Accordingly, the Russian syndicate
undertook to fell trees at Mu-san in 1897 and
again in 1898,<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c014'><sup>[560]</sup></a> though never on a large scale.<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c014'><sup>[561]</sup></a>
On the Uinung Island, however, where good timber
had nearly been exhausted after many years of cutting
by the Japanese, the Russians had at no time
made a serious attempt to exploit it. Under these
circumstances, the right of the Russians to exploit
forests upon the Yalu so late as 1903 was at least
not clear.<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c014'><sup>[562]</sup></a> Nevertheless, the extensive public works
at Port Arthur and Dalny and on the railways
had created so great a demand for timber, that
the Chinese woodmen were cutting trees along the
foot of the Long White Mountains and sending
them downstream to An-tung, where alone the
traffic annually aggregated the sum of 1,500,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span><em>taels</em>.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c014'><sup>[563]</sup></a> The Russians now seemed to have planned
to exploit both sides of the Yalu, and they would
not have caused trouble, had they employed legitimate
means to accomplish their ends. On the Manchurian
side, finding that a foreigner could not get
a timber concession from the Chinese authorities,
they used the name of a leader of the mounted
bandits whom a Russian military officer had befriended,
and, after securing a concession, employed
those bandits in felling trees.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c014'><sup>[564]</sup></a> In regard to the
Korean side of the river, after nearly seven years’
inactivity since the grant of the concession, M.
Stein, Russian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé</span></i> at Seul, suddenly notified
the Korean Government, on April 13, 1903, that
Baron Gunzburg would henceforth represent at Seul
the interest of the timber syndicate, which would
now commence its work upon the Yalu.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c014'><sup>[565]</sup></a> Early in
May, forty-seven Russian soldiers in civilian dress,
presently increased to sixty, besides a larger number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>of Chinese and Koreans under Russian employ,
were reported to have come to Yong-am-po,<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c014'><sup>[566]</sup></a> a point
near the mouth of the river and rather remote from
the places<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c014'><sup>[567]</sup></a> where actual cutting was in progress,
and had begun to construct what was claimed to be
timber-warehouses, but later proved to be, besides
some godowns, a blacksmith plant and a six-foot
mound.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c014'><sup>[568]</sup></a> At the same time, there was taking place
a mysterious mobilization of troops from Liao-yang
and Port Arthur towards Fêng-hwang-Chêng and
An-tung on the other side of the Yalu.<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c014'><sup>[569]</sup></a> The Korean
frontier officers reported that a panic had been
created among the inhabitants, and that the Korean-Manchurian
commerce had stopped.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c014'><sup>[570]</sup></a> Presently, the
Russian soldiers at Yong-am-po were reported to
have been increased, first by 100, and then by 200,
who purchased from the natives, under the name of
a Korean citizen and against the wishes of the local
authorities, fifteen houses and some twelve acres of
land.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c014'><sup>[571]</sup></a> When the Korean Government had, on May
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>15, demanded of M. Stein to order the evacuation
of the Russians,<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c014'><sup>[572]</sup></a> M. Pavloff, who had recently returned
from his trip to Russia, requested, on the
contrary, that the Korean Government should protect
the Russian subjects at Yong-am-po.<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c014'><sup>[573]</sup></a> A desultory
discussion then ensued between M. Pavloff and
the Korean Government, while further increases
of the Russian forces at An-tung beyond the river
were reducing the frontier regions generally into a
state of anarchy.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c014'><sup>[574]</sup></a> About the middle of June, the
Russians forcibly seized rafts belonging to some
Koreans and Chinese that came down the stream,
and shot two Chinese who resisted.<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c014'><sup>[575]</sup></a> A Japanese-Chinese
syndicate, also, which had secured a timber
concession in this region in March from the Korean
Government, reported that its rafts had been seized,
and its work had consequently been suspended.<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c014'><sup>[576]</sup></a>
Prior to this, four Russian war-vessels under command
of Admiral Starck came to Chemulpo in the
night of June 5,<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c014'><sup>[577]</sup></a> and stayed there till the 11th. No
matter whether there was any significance in this
act, it is sufficient to record that it took place at
this critical moment. Not the least serious feature
of the affair was the disagreement of opinion about
it inside the Korean Government. When, on June
11, the Council of State passed a resolution that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>conduct of the Russians upon the frontier was contrary
to the treaty arrangements between the two
Powers, the Foreign Office, on the 14th, sought to
refute the ground in an elaborate note.<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c014'><sup>[578]</sup></a> The gravity
of the situation as evinced in all these facts need
hardly be pointed out. Whatever the intentions of
the Russian Government or even of its Representative
at Seul, the action of the Muscovites at Yong-am-po
was precisely of a nature to remind one of
their previous fortification of Port Arthur, which
had eventually prepared their entry into the whole
of Manchuria. The fact that the occupation of
Yong-am-po took place simultaneously with the
suspension of the evacuation of Manchuria and with
the active military connection between its army
centres and the Korean frontier, gave the present
affair an exceedingly ominous appearance. And
yet, in the face of these perilous circumstances, the
Korean Government showed itself so impotent and
so little alive to the situation as to be divided
against itself on a minor point of the law of the
case. In such a state of things, the usual method
of Japan to resist Russia through Korea would be
utterly futile.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is unnecessary to recall that any attempt upon
the integrity of Korea was in violation of the fundamental
principle which formed the first Article
of the Nishi-Rosen Protocol of April 25, 1898,<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c014'><sup>[579]</sup></a>
as well as against the spirit of this and the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>other Russo-Japanese agreements regarding Korea.
These agreements seemed to Japan to have in one
way or another been palpably violated by the Russians
in many of their actions in Korea, to which
the Yong-am-po affair was a climax. Under circumstances
so continually irritating to the peace
of the East and so threatening to her own vital
interests, the Government of Japan now felt justified,
when the climax was reached, in opening
<em>direct</em> negotiations with Russia, in order to arrive
at such a definite understanding of the relative
position of the Powers in Korea, as would insure
the mutual benefit of the three nations concerned.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was in view of these dangerously unstable circumstances
in Manchuria and Korea that, on June
23, 1903, the four principal members of the Japanese
Cabinet<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c014'><sup>[580]</sup></a> and five Privy Councilors<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c014'><sup>[581]</sup></a> met
before the Throne, and decided on the principles
upon which negotiations with Russia should be
opened.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c014'><sup>[582]</sup></a> Having thus formulated the policy to be
pursued, Baron Komura telegraphed to the Japanese
Minister at St. Petersburg, Mr. Kurino, on
July 28, as follows<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c014'><sup>[583]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div id='i_326'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>BARON KOMURA<br /><br /><em>Japanese Foreign Minister</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>“The Imperial Government [of Japan] have observed
with close attention the development of affairs in Manchuria,
and its present situation causes them to view it
with grave concern.</p>

<p class='c032'>“So long as it was hoped that Russia would carry out,
on the one hand, the engagement that she made with
China, and, on the other, the assurances she had given
to other Powers, regarding the subject of the evacuation
of Manchuria, the Imperial Government maintained an
attitude of watchful reserve. But the recent conduct of
Russia has been, at Peking, to propose new demands, and,
in Manchuria, to tighten her hold upon it, until the Imperial
Government is led to believe that Russia must have
abandoned the intention of retiring from Manchuria.
At the same time, her increased activity upon the Korean
frontier is such as to raise doubts as to the limits of her
ambition.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The unconditioned and permanent occupation of
Manchuria by Russia would create a state of things prejudicial
to the security and interest of Japan. The principle
of equal opportunity would thereby be annulled,
and the territorial integrity of China impaired. There is,
however, a still more serious consideration for the Japanese
Government. That is to say, if Russia was established
on the flank of Korea, it would be a constant menace to
the separate existence of that Empire, or at least would
make Russia the dominant Power in Korea. Korea is an
important outpost in Japan’s line of defense, and Japan
consequently considers her independence absolutely essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>to her own repose and safety. Moreover, the political
as well as commercial and industrial interests and influence
which Japan possesses in Korea are paramount
over those of other Powers. These interests and influence,
Japan, having regard to her own security, cannot consent
to surrender to, or share with, another Power.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Imperial Government, after the most serious
consideration, have resolved to consult the Russian Government,
in a spirit of conciliation and frankness, with a
view to the conclusion of an understanding designed to
compose questions which are at this time the cause of
their anxiety. In the estimation of the Imperial Government,
the moment is opportune for making the attempt
to bring about the desired adjustment, and it is believed
that, failing this opportunity, there would be no room for
another understanding.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Imperial Government, reposing confidence in
your judgment and discretion, have decided to place the
delicate negotiations in your hands.</p>

<p class='c032'>“It being the wish of the Imperial Government to place
their present invitation to the Russian Government entirely
on an official footing, you are accordingly instructed
to open the question by presenting to Count Lamsdorff,
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">note verbale</span></i> to
the following effect:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Japanese Government desire to remove from
the relations of the two Empires every cause of future
misunderstanding, and believe that the Russian Government
share the same desire. The Japanese Government
would therefore be glad to enter with the Imperial Russian
Government upon an examination of the condition
of affairs in the regions of the extreme East, where their
interests meet, with a view to defining their respective
special interests in those regions.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘If this suggestion fortunately meets with the approval,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>in principle, of the Russian Government, the Japanese
Government will be prepared to present to the Russian
Government their views as to the nature and scope of
the proposed understanding.’</p>

<p class='c032'>“In presenting the foregoing note to the Russian Foreign
Minister, you will be careful to make him understand
that our purposes are entirely friendly, but that we
attach great importance to the subject.</p>

<p class='c032'>“You will present the note to Count Lamsdorff as soon
as possible, and keep me fully informed regarding the
steps taken by you under this instruction; and immediately
upon the receipt of an affirmative reply from the
Russian Government, the substance of our proposals will
be telegraphed to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To this request of Japan, Count Lamsdorff expressed
a perfect agreement,<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c014'><sup>[584]</sup></a> for, as he had very
often said to Mr. Kurino, “an understanding between
the two countries was not only desirable, but
was the best policy.” “Should Russia and Japan
enter into a full understanding,” said he, “no one
would in future attempt to sow the seeds of discord
between the two countries.”<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c014'><sup>[585]</sup></a> The assent of
the Foreign Minister was later sustained by the
Czar.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c014'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the way was opened for an amicable interchange
of the views of the two Powers. This
auspicious beginning of the negotiations stands
in striking contrast to their disastrous end. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>discrepancy was perhaps in no small measure due
to a political situation at St. Petersburg which
was completely beyond the control of Count Lamsdorff,
and probably also of the Czar. It should be
remembered that Baron Komura, like Marquis
Itō, was of the opinion that the conclusion of a
satisfactory agreement with Russia was not only
desirable, but also possible. The same belief was
strongly shared by Mr. Kurino. It is also difficult
to suppose that Count Lamsdorff entered upon
the negotiations with a deliberate intention to introduce
into them insurmountable difficulties, as he
was presently obliged to do, so as to bring them to
a complete deadlock. On the contrary, his remarks
quoted in the preceding paragraph seem to indicate
that he and Mr. Kurino had frequently talked of
the wisdom of coming to a perfect adjustment of the
interests of the two Powers in the East, and that
he was gratified that the opportunity was offered
by the Japanese Government to give effect to what
he had long considered “the best policy.” About
this time, however, it had begun to be surmised
abroad that the peace party, with which the Count
and M. Witte were said to be in sympathy, had been
largely overshadowed by the less intelligent warlike
faction. It was unknown what were the results of
the observations of General Kuropatkin, the then
Minister of War, who had made a tour of the East
between the end of April and the end of July. Nor
was it possible to discover what took place in the
great conference held at Port Arthur early in July,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>in which the General, as well as Admiral Alexieff,
MM. Lessar, Pavloff, Rosen, and Pokotiloff, took
part. However that may be, it could hardly be
denied that henceforth the Eastern affairs passed
under the sway of a less thoughtful body of men
at St. Petersburg, and of that executive officer of
great talent, but strategist and diplomat of unknown
value, Admiral Alexieff, at Port Arthur. M. Witte
was relieved of his Ministry of Finance, and transferred
to the presidency of the council of ministers,
which was known to be of small real authority. On
August 13, an Imperial <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ukase</span></i> was published in the
Russian <cite>Official Messenger</cite>, stating that, “in view
of the complex problems of administration of the
eastern confines of the Empire, we [the Czar Nicolas]
found it necessary to create a power capable
of assuring the peaceful development of the country
and satisfying urgent local needs.” For this
purpose, a special vice-regency called the Far East
was created out of the Amur and Kwan-tung territories,
and Admiral Alexieff was appointed Viceroy
of the Far East. He was vested with supreme
power in the civil administration of the territories,
with the command of the naval forces in the Pacific
and of all the troops quartered in the country
under his jurisdiction, and with the management of
the diplomatic relations of these regions with the
neighboring States. The Viceroy was released from
the jurisdiction of the Ministers at St. Petersburg,
and the only control to be exercised over him by
the central power was through a special committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>of men<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c014'><sup>[587]</sup></a> nominated by the Czar and presided over
by himself.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c014'><sup>[588]</sup></a> Statutes concerning this special committee
of the Far East—which has in itself no
executive power—were promulgated on September
30.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c014'><sup>[589]</sup></a> When we consider the probable state of
Russian politics at the time, the significance of
thus elevating Alexieff and clothing him with enormous
powers could hardly be concealed. Henceforth
the control of the Eastern diplomacy of Russia
seemed to have rested more with the Viceroy at
Port Arthur than with the Foreign Minister at St.
Petersburg.<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c014'><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Admiral Alexieff was appointed Viceroy on August
13. On the preceding day,<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c014'><sup>[591]</sup></a> the first Japanese
note was handed to Count Lamsdorff by Mr. Kurino,
who had held it for about a week pending the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>Czar’s assent to Japan’s proposition of July 28,
already quoted. In this note, delivered on August
12, Baron Komura wrote as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“In reference to my telegram of the 28th July, the
Imperial Government, after giving most serious consideration
to the condition of affairs in those regions where
the interests of the two Powers meet, have decided to
propose the following articles as the basis of an understanding
between Japan and Russia:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. ‘A mutual engagement to respect the independence
and territorial integrity of the Chinese and Korean Empires,
and to maintain the principle of equal opportunity
for the commerce and industry of all nations in those
countries.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. ‘A reciprocal recognition of Japan’s preponderating
interests in Korea and Russia’s special interests in
railway enterprises in Manchuria, and of the right of
Japan to take in Korea, and of Russia to take in Manchuria,
such measures as may be necessary for the protection
of their respective interests as above defined,
subject, however, to the provisions of Article 1 of this
Agreement.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. ‘A reciprocal undertaking on the part of Russia
and Japan not to impede the development of those industrial
and commercial activities, respectively, of Japan
in Korea and of Russia in Manchuria, which are not inconsistent
with the stipulations of Article 1 of this Agreement.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘An additional engagement on the part of Russia not
to impede the eventual extension of the Korean Railway
into Southern Manchuria so as to connect with the Eastern
Chinese and Shan-hai-kwan-Niu-chwang lines.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. ‘A reciprocal engagement that, in case it should be
found necessary to send troops by Japan to Korea, or by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Russia to Manchuria, for the purpose either of protecting
the interests mentioned in Article 2 of this Agreement,
or of suppressing insurrection or disorder liable to create
international complications, the troops so sent are in no
case to exceed the actual number required, and are to be
forthwith recalled as soon as their missions are accomplished.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. ‘The recognition on the part of Russia of the
exclusive right of Japan to give advice and assistance in
the interest of reform and good government in Korea,
including necessary military assistance.</p>

<p class='c032'>“6. ‘This Agreement to supersede all previous arrangements
between Japan and Russia respecting Korea.’</p>

<p class='c032'>“In handing the foregoing project to Count Lamsdorff,”
wrote Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino in the same dispatch
which contained the proposed Articles, “you will say that
it is presented for the consideration of the Russian Government
in the firm belief that it may be found adequate
to serve as a basis upon which to construct a satisfactory
arrangement between the two Governments, and you will
assure Count Lamsdorff that any amendment or suggestion
he may find it necessary to offer will receive the immediate
and friendly consideration of the Imperial Government.
It will not be necessary for you to say much in
elucidation of the separate items of the project, as they
are largely self-explanatory; but you might point out
that the project taken as a whole will be found to be little
more than a logical extension and amplification of the
principles already recognized by, or of conditions embodied
in the previous engagements<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c014'><sup>[592]</sup></a> concluded between,

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>These articles are memorable, as their more essential
features were never altered in the later notes
from Japan, as the persistent rejection by Russia of
the principles embodied in these articles inevitably
ended in hostilities, and, the most important of all,
as much of the future of the East would seem to
depend upon whether these principles should win
or fail through the war. The principles were as
obvious as the note was “largely self-explanatory.”
At their basis was the desire for a general, lasting
peace of the Far East, or, in other words, an effective
elimination of unnatural, irritating circumstances,
so that the East may develop its enormous material
and moral resources, and thereby establish with
the West an intimate and mutually beneficial relationship.
Upon this fundamental desire were built
two great principles, which had long been the
mottoes of Eastern diplomacy; namely, the territorial
integrity of, and the “open door” in, China
and Korea. These principles, which Russia had
frequently avowed on her own initiative, Japan
now requested her to uphold mutually with herself.
Side by side with these considerations, the vested
interests and the peculiar position, respectively, of
Russia in Manchuria and Japan in Korea, were to be
reciprocally recognized by the two Powers, in such
a way, however, as not to infringe the two great
principles already named. Observe that the Russian
interests in Manchuria were not less respected than
the Japanese interests in Korea, nor was the Russian
occupation of Manchuria more guarded against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>than the Japanese annexation of Korea. The only
ground in the note for a possible misinterpretation
was the Article which provided for Japan’s sole
right to advise and aid Korea for the cause of the
good government and reform of the latter. Experience
had shown that the independence and progress
of Korea, upon which one half of Japan’s own
future rested, would be possible only by the internal
reform and development of the Peninsular Empire,
and that, unfortunately, the task of reform could
not safely be left either with the indolent Korea
or with another Power, be it China or Russia, whose
ultimate object would be best served were Korea to
remain feeble. The reform of Korea may truly be
called the penalty of Japan’s geographical position,
and the latter’s success in the fulfillment of this
most delicate mission must depend on her sense
of just proportion and utmost self-control. And
nothing seems to kindle the Japanese nation with
a higher ambition than their profound determination
to perform what they deem their historic mission
in the fairest spirit of human progress. Only along
these lines, moreover, by a peculiar coincidence of
circumstances, the securest interests of Japan as a
nation seem to lie. For it appears to be her singular
fortune that her interests become every year
more closely tied with the best tried principles of
progress. Upon fairness her life depends, and upon
it the natural growth of the millions of the East
would seem to rest. It appeared, therefore, evident
to the Japanese statesmen that in no other manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>than along the course suggested by their propositions
to Russia could the welfare of all the interested
parties be assured, and the future repose and
progress of the East guaranteed. On the other
hand, however, nothing could be more distasteful
to the party presumably in control of the Eastern
policy of Russia at the time than the reciprocal understanding
proposed by Mr. Kurino in his note of
August 12.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before replying to this note, Count Lamsdorff
suddenly demanded, on August 23, that negotiations
should be conducted at Tokio instead of at St.
Petersburg, as had been desired by Japan<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c014'><sup>[594]</sup></a>. This
move of Russia was closely parallel to the policy
she once pursued in China regarding the lease of
Port Arthur, when she declined to negotiate at the
Russian Capital<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c014'><sup>[595]</sup></a>. A discussion at St. Petersburg
might save it from many of the vexatious delays
which would naturally attend its being held at an
Eastern capital, away from the Foreign Office of
the Power whose interest counseled procrastination.
Of the several reasons presented by Russia for her
proposition, one was that the local knowledge of
Viceroy Alexieff had constantly to be consulted.
Japan pointed out that the proposed Agreement
concerned matters of principle, and not of local
detail<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c014'><sup>[596]</sup></a>. Her repeated request, however, to negotiate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>at St. Petersburg was firmly refused by Russia, as
was also Japan’s suggestion that her note be made
the basis of the discussion.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c014'><sup>[597]</sup></a> Negotiations were
therefore transferred to Tokio, and the Japanese
note and the Russian counter-note—the latter not
then received—were together to serve as the base
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourparlers</span></i><a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c014'><sup>[598]</sup></a>. This question, which marked
the beginning of many long delays to follow, itself
consumed two weeks before any real progress of the
negotiations could be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a delay of nearly eight weeks, Russia, on
October 3, sent her counter-note, which, as will be
seen from the following telegram of the 5th, from
Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino, revealed the utter
irreconcilability of the wishes of the two Powers:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Baron Rosen [Russian Minister at Tokio] came back
from Port Arthur on the 3d instant. He called on me
the same day, and handed me the following as the Russian
counter-proposals, which, he said, had been sanctioned
by His Majesty the Emperor of Russia, upon the
joint representations of Admiral Alexieff and himself:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. ‘Mutual engagement to respect the independence
and territorial integrity of the Korean Empire.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. ‘Recognition by Russia of Japan’s preponderating
interests in Korea, and of the right of Japan to give advice
and assistance to Korea tending to improve the civil
administration of the Empire without infringing the stipulations
of Article 1.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. ‘Engagement on the part of Russia not to impede
the commercial and industrial undertakings of Japan in
Korea, nor to oppose any measures taken for the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>of protecting them, so long as such measures do not
infringe the stipulations of Article 1.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. ‘Recognition of the right of Japan to send, for the
same purpose, troops to Korea, with the knowledge of
Russia, but their number not to exceed that actually required,
and with the engagement on the part of Japan
to recall such troops as soon as their mission is accomplished.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. ‘Mutual engagement not to use any part of the
territory of Korea for strategical purposes, nor to undertake
on the coasts of Korea any military works capable
of menacing the freedom of navigation in the Straits of
Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“6. ‘Mutual engagement to consider that part of the
territory of Korea lying to the north of the thirty-ninth
parallel as a neutral zone into which neither of the contracting
parties shall introduce troops.</p>

<p class='c032'>“7. ‘Recognition by Japan of Manchuria and its littoral
as in all respects outside her sphere of interest.</p>

<p class='c032'>“8. ‘This Agreement to supersede all previous agreements
between Russia and Japan regarding Korea.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c014'><sup>[599]</sup></a>’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In comparing this counter-note with the original
note of Japan, it will at once be seen that Russia
seriously reduced Japan’s demands concerning Korea
by excluding her right of rendering advice and
assistance to Korea in the latter’s military affairs,
and also by quietly suppressing the important
clause providing for mutual recognition of the
principle of the equal economic opportunity for all
nations in Korea. Moreover, Russia imposed upon
Japan the following new conditions regarding Korea:
not to use any part of the territory for strategical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>purposes; not to fortify the southern coast;
and to consider the territory north of the thirty-ninth
parallel, covering nearly one third of the area
of the Empire, as neutral<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c014'><sup>[600]</sup></a> between the two Powers.
As regards Manchuria, Russia silently discarded the
two fundamental principles proposed by Japan and
often avowed by Russia herself, namely, China’s
sovereignty over it and the equal economic opportunity
for all nations therein. On the contrary, Russia
requested Japan to declare Manchuria and its littoral
as outside of her sphere of interest. If the Power
which exchanged necessaries of life with Manchuria
in fast growing quantities, controlled more than
ninety per cent. of the exports at Niu-chwang, and
numbered tens of thousands of its subjects residing
in the Three Provinces, should be required by
Russia to declare itself uninterested in Manchuria,
the exclusive designs of Russia upon the territory
would seem to need no stronger proof. The
general tenor of the note of October 3 was, thus,
to exclude Manchuria from discussion, and, furthermore,
to restrict Japan’s influence in Korea. Russia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>explained that the question of Manchuria rested
between herself and China, and that she had no reason
to make any arrangement about it with a third
Power. To this, Japan replied that she had asked
from Russia no concession of any kind in Manchuria,
but merely requested her to recognize anew the
principles which she had voluntarily and repeatedly
professed. Such a recognition, Japan contended,
was of vital interest to her, inasmuch as the Russian
occupation of Manchuria would continually threaten
the independence of Korea.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c014'><sup>[601]</sup></a> It was evident from
Russia’s counter-note that there lay an impassable
gulf between the propositions of the two Powers,
not only in the actual terms under discussion, but
also in the principles involved in them, for, to all
appearance, nothing could prove more clearly that
Russia was bent upon absorbing and closing up all
Manchuria, as well as marking out Northern Korea
as an eventual sphere of her influence, and that she
was unwilling to recognize the profound and increasing
common interest of Japan and Manchuria, and
the vital importance to the former of the independence,
strength, and development of Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>The date fixed in the Convention in April, 1902,
for the final evacuation of Manchuria arrived on
October 8, 1903—five days after the Russian
counter-note was received by Japan, but the day
came and passed with no sign of the evacuation.
On the contrary, the Russian Minister at Peking
was engaged, regardless of the negotiations at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Tokio between his Government and the Japanese,
in urging Prince Ching to change the terms of
the Convention. Those who had been impressed
by the manner and contents of the Russian reply
to the Japanese note did not fail to observe in M.
Lessar’s conduct at Peking another proof of the
slight weight which the Russians attached to the
overtures of Japan at least concerning Manchuria.
For, if Russia succeeded in securing China’s consent
to her new demands regarding Manchuria, which
in every way transgressed the principles contained
in the Japanese note, the Manchurian negotiations
between Russia and Japan would become unnecessary.
The Russian course of action at Tokio and
Peking was thus consistent in ignoring Japan’s
vital interests in Manchuria, and, therefore, was
regarded as consistently insulting to Japan. The
secret of the situation seemed to be, as has been
already suggested, that the centre of gravity of
Russian diplomacy in the East had largely shifted
from St. Petersburg to Port Arthur—from Count
Lamsdorff to the inflexible Admiral Alexieff. Ever
since the latter had convened, at Port Arthur, early
in July, a large council of the diplomatic, military
and naval, and financial agents of Russia in the
Eastern Asiatic countries, as well as General Kuropatkin,
who was then traveling in the Orient, it
had appeared that the Viceroy of the Far East,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c014'><sup>[602]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>not the Foreign Office at the Russian Capital, was
the guiding spirit of the Czar’s policy in Korea,
China, and Japan. Hereafter, Count Lamsdorff
could perhaps moderate the terms, and transmit to
Japan the revised contents, of the Viceroy’s unconciliatory
views, but had otherwise lost the control
of the situation. The reason why Alexieff had
risen to such a great influence may not be known
until the relations he had with M. Bezobrazoff, the
late von Plehve, and other influential politicians at
St. Petersburg of that day, become more clearly
understood than they are to-day. As to the probable
views of the Viceroy regarding the situation
in the East, it is not hard to infer them from the
diplomatic history in China, Korea, and Japan, during
the half year ending with February, 1904.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us make a brief review of the diplomatic
manœuvres of the Russian Representative at Peking
regarding Manchuria, which proceeded much as if
his Government were not engaged in negotiations
with Japan in respect to the same territory. The
secret Manchurian agreement which was reported
to have been concluded on July 20<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c014'><sup>[603]</sup></a> was probably
unfounded, and its detail may otherwise be safely
left unnoticed. The nature of the Russian policy
regarding Manchuria could, however, be inferred
from the remarkable exchange of views which took
place at London in July between Lord Lansdowne
and the Russian Ambassador, Count Benckendorff.
In this interview on July 11, the latter said, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>effect: “Whatever may be the result of the negotiations
which are pending between Russia and
China,&nbsp;... the Imperial Government [of Russia]
has no intention of opposing the gradual opening
of China, as <em>commercial relations develop</em>,<a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> of some
towns in Manchuria to foreign commerce, <em>excluding,
however, the right to establish ‘Settlements.’</em>
This declaration does not apply to Harbin. The
town in question being within the limits of the concessions
for the Eastern Chinese Railway, <em>is not
unrestrictedly subject to the Chinese Government</em>;<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c014'><sup>[604]</sup></a>
the establishment there of foreign consulates must
therefore depend upon the consent of the Russian
Government.”<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c014'><sup>[605]</sup></a> The three conditions here printed
in italics would seem not only contradictory to the
declaration made by Count Lamsdorff to Mr. MacCormick
on April 28,<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c014'><sup>[606]</sup></a> but also almost tantamount
to opposing the opening of any new treaty port in
Manchuria. For it was well understood that the
desire on the part of some Powers for the speedy
opening of some new ports in Manchuria was largely
calculated to prevent the aggressive and exclusive
proceedings of Russia in that territory. If, as Count
Benckendorff suggested, the development of trade
relations was the sole reason for “gradually” opening
some towns, if foreign settlements should be
excluded from the new ports, and if Harbin, and
logically all the towns situated at the “depots” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the railway, could not be opened without Russian
consent, Manchuria, excepting the regions touching
the few towns which had already been opened,
would remain open to the growing influence of
Russia, but practically sealed to the rest of the
world.<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c014'><sup>[607]</sup></a> This inference was presently demonstrated
by the new demands made at the Peking Foreign
Office by M. Lessar on September 6. These demands,
presented, as they were, in the midst of the
Russo-Japanese negotiations at Tokio and on the
eve of the close of the period of Manchurian evacuation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>deserve a special notice. Briefly stated, M.
Lessar requested: (1) that China should not alienate,
in any manner, any port, of whatever size, of Manchuria
to any other Power; (2) that Russia should
be allowed to construct wharves on the Sungari
River, to connect them by telegraph, and to station
Russian troops to protect the telegraph lines and
the ships plying the river; (3) that Russia should
be allowed to establish post stations along the road
from Tsitishar to Blagovestchensk; (4) that no
greater duties should be imposed on goods brought
into Manchuria by rail than those now imposed on
goods transported by road or river; (5) that after
the withdrawal of the Russian troops, the branches
of the Russo-Chinese Bank should be protected by
Chinese troops, but at the cost of the Bank; and
(6) that a Russian doctor should be appointed member
of the Sanitary Board at Niu-chwang. On these
conditions, the Russian forces would evacuate Niu-chwang
and the rest of the Sheng-king Province on
October 8, the Kirin Province after four months,
and the Hei-lung Province at the end of one year.<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c014'><sup>[608]</sup></a>
Of these, the first demand was interpreted to imply
the prevention of the establishment of new foreign
settlements and concessions in any part of Manchuria.
As to the meaning of stationing troops along
the Sungari and building a post road from Tsitsihar
to Blagovestchensk, it is instructive to observe that
Prince Ching opined that, if China conceded these
demands and Russia then nominally withdrew, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>latter would still be in virtual possession of the
territory.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c014'><sup>[609]</sup></a> The British and Japanese Ministers at
Peking naturally warned China not to accept the
Russian propositions.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c014'><sup>[610]</sup></a> The Foreign Office, after
some hesitation,<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c014'><sup>[611]</sup></a> finally refused all of the demands
in a written note, on September 24.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c014'><sup>[612]</sup></a> This refusal,
however, by no means terminated the Manchurian
negotiations at Peking. As the Chinese Government
showed inclinations, vacillating as they were, to
sympathize with Japan in her efforts to maintain
the sovereign rights of China in Manchuria, M.
Lessar is said to have resorted to occasional threats
that, if a war should occur between Russia and
Japan and the latter be defeated, China would repent
her sorry plight only too late, for then Manchuria
would not be hers. Particularly vigorous
was his obstruction of the effort of the United
States Commissioners at Shanghai to secure the
opening of new ports in Manchuria to foreign
trade.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c014'><sup>[613]</sup></a> In spite of all this, however, on October 8—the
very day once fixed for the final evacuation
of Manchuria—the American-Chinese treaty was
signed, opening Mukden and An-tung as treaty
ports. The next day saw the conclusion of the
Japanese-Chinese treaty, bearing the date of October
8, which also provided for the opening of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>Mukden and Tatung-kao. It was perhaps nothing
more than a singular coincidence of circumstances
that Mukden should be, as it was, occupied by Russian
soldiers shortly after its opening had been secured
by the United States and Japan. Early in the
morning of October 28, 780 Russian soldiers with
eight cannon suddenly, without warning, rushed
through the city gate and took possession of the
<em>Yamên</em> of the Tartar General, Tsêng-chi, holding
him in custody and reducing the military forces
under his control.<a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> A generally accepted ground for
this precipitous act was naught more than that a
subordinate Taotai under the jurisdiction of the
Tartar General had undertaken to punish some
recalcitrant bandits who had been under Russian
employ. The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal de Saint Pétersbourg</span></cite> explained,
however, that the seizure of Mukden was
owing “to the apathy of the Chinese authorities,
to the non-execution of the promises made on their
part, and to the agitation which prevailed in the district.”<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c014'><sup>[614]</sup></a>
Mukden being the sepulchral city of the
reigning dynasty of China, its sudden occupation
by the Russians appeared to have aroused a bitter
resentment among the educated classes throughout
the Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning to the Korean frontier, the conduct of
the Russians at Yong-am-po<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c014'><sup>[615]</sup></a> on the left side of the
Yalu, near its mouth, had now assumed an unmistakably
political character. Early in July a telegraphic
connection had been made without permission with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>An-tung, a strategic centre in Eastern Manchuria.
At the instance of the Japanese Minister, the
Korean Government succeeded in enforcing the removal
of the line.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c014'><sup>[616]</sup></a> Late in the same month, the
Commissioner of Forestry of Korea and Baron
Gunzburg visited Yong-am-po, and drafted an agreement
leasing the port to the Timber Company,
nominally represented by the Baron. The contract
bore neither a definite period of time for the lease
nor fixed area of the leased territory, in the Korean
text of the agreement, but, according to the Russian
document, the lease is said to have extended
over twenty years and covered a space equivalent
to 204 acres. The company also was granted, in
the Korean text, judiciary rights over the residents
within the leased area.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c014'><sup>[617]</sup></a> At the same time, extensive
works had been started by the Russians at
Yong-am-po, including the erection of large brick
buildings and the laying out of roads, streets, and
light railways, to be later increased by what was
conceded to be a fort; while, beyond the river, the
military forces at An-tung and other centres had
been in the process of augmentation.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c014'><sup>[618]</sup></a> The situation
had now become so grave that Mr. Hayashi,
Japanese Minister at Seul, was obliged to enter
sharp protests at the Korean Foreign Office against
the conclusion of the lease agreement,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c014'><sup>[619]</sup></a> and to urge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>again the opening of Wiju, and now also of Yong-am-po,
to foreign trade. Both the British and
American Representatives also pressed the Seul
Government to open these ports.<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c014'><sup>[620]</sup></a> The Russian
Minister, M. Pavloff, however, was as strenuously
opposed to the opening of these ports as Mr.
Hayashi was to the conclusion of the lease agreement.
The conditions were almost identical with
those in 1898 under which Great Britain urged
the opening of Talien-wan, so as to counteract the
Russian aggression upon it and Port Arthur, and
also with those in Manchuria, in this same year,
where the American and Japanese Governments demanded
the opening of new ports in order to prevent
the exclusion of foreign trade and industry
from Manchuria under Russian rule. The struggle
between the open and the exclusive policy, however,
continued much longer in Korea than in
China, owing largely to the extremely unstable
political conditions at Seul, which enabled the
Russian diplomats oftener and longer to influence
the Korean court.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c014'><sup>[621]</sup></a> As regards the lease of
Yong-am-po, the Korean Government was now so
alive to the serious nature of the agreement that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>it proposed to modify its terms late in August.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c014'><sup>[622]</sup></a>
M. Pavloff, however, persistently urged the Korean
Government to ratify the original agreement. On
August 27, for instance, he and Baron Gunzburg
remained at the Foreign Office from one to six
o’clock in the afternoon, requesting the immediate
conclusion of the contract, until the Foreign Minister
escaped out of the door and tendered his
resignation.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c014'><sup>[623]</sup></a> At the same time, the conduct of the
Russians on the frontier grew even more menacing
than before. The cutting of timber was started at
different points, where many Koreans were forced
into unpaid service, and the bandits in Russian
employ created disorder among peaceful citizens.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c014'><sup>[624]</sup></a>
Moreover, according to the reports of Korean officials,
the Russians had occupied at Yong-am-po—now
named Nicolas—a ground far more extensive
than the lease-area stipulated in the yet unratified
agreement.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c014'><sup>[625]</sup></a> All this while, the Russians at the
Capital exercised a powerful influence over both Yi
Keun-thaik and Yi Yong-ik, two of the most noted
politicians at Seul, and over the strong party upholding
the interests of Lady Öm.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c014'><sup>[626]</sup></a> It was through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>these pro-Russian people that the unique idea of
declaring the neutrality of Korea before the outbreak
of any war—an idea which had more than
once been unsuccessfully proposed<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c014'><sup>[627]</sup></a>—was again
brought forward, and finally, early in 1904, carried
into effect in an awkward manner.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c014'><sup>[628]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Russian activity in Korea and Manchuria, which
has been briefly described, may be said to constitute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>the reverse side of the diplomacy of the Czar’s
Government at Tokio. The actual control of the
Eastern situation having probably passed from the
central power to Port Arthur, it was now founded,
perhaps not upon greater practical wisdom than
before, but apparently upon a uniform basis. For
the conclusion is forced upon the student that
Viceroy Alexieff’s policy must have been, on the one
hand, to deal with Japan’s overtures lightly and
leisurely, but, on the other, to hasten the establishment
of Russian control in Manchuria and upon
the Korean frontier, so that Japan might in time
be compelled to bow to the situation and accept
terms dictated by Russia. The proof of this policy
had already seemed abundantly sufficient by the
time when the Russian counter-note reached Baron
Komura on October 3. It is impossible to tell
whether, in framing such a policy, the Viceroy had
taken into consideration the fact that the entire
nation of Japan felt as one man that they had come
to the greatest crisis known in their long history.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <span class='large'>THE RUSSO-JAPANESE NEGOTIATIONS, II</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Russian counter-note having been received on
October 3, Baron Komura began to confer with
Baron Rosen upon the basis of both the Japanese
note and the Russian reply.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c014'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Meanwhile, the Japanese
statesmen again held deliberations on the 10th
and 24th of October,<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c014'><sup>[630]</sup></a> and agreed upon the “irreducible
minimum,” which was accordingly communicated
to the Russian Minister on the 30th in the
form of the following note:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. Mutual engagement to respect the independence
and territorial integrity of the Chinese and Korean Empires.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. Recognition by Russia of Japan’s preponderating
interests in Korea, and of the right of Japan to give to
Korea advice and assistance, including military assistance,
tending to improve the administration of the Korean
Empire.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. Engagement on the part of Russia not to impede
the development of the commercial and industrial activities
of Japan in Korea, nor to oppose any measures
taken for the purpose of protecting those interests.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. Recognition by Russia of the right of Japan to
send troops to Korea for the purpose mentioned in the
preceding Article, or for the purpose of suppressing insurrection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>or disorder calculated to create international
complications.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. Engagement on the part of Japan not to undertake
on the coasts of Korea any military works capable
of menacing the freedom of navigation in the Korean
Straits.</p>

<p class='c032'>“6. Mutual engagement to establish a neutral zone
on the Korean-Manchurian frontier extending fifty kilometres
on each side, into which zone neither of the contracting
parties shall introduce troops without the consent
of the other.</p>

<p class='c032'>“7. Recognition by Japan that Manchuria is outside
her sphere of special interest, and recognition by Russia
that Korea is outside her sphere of special interest.</p>

<p class='c032'>“8. Recognition by Japan of Russia’s special interests
in Manchuria, and of the right of Russia to take such
measures as may be necessary for the protection of those
interests.</p>

<p class='c032'>“9. Engagement on the part of Japan not to interfere
with the commercial and residential rights and immunities
belonging to Russia in virtue of her treaty engagements
with Korea, and engagement on the part of
Russia not to interfere with the commercial and residential
rights and immunities belonging to Japan in virtue
of her treaty engagements with China.</p>

<p class='c032'>“10. Mutual engagement not to impede the connection
of the Korean Railway and the Eastern Chinese
Railway when those railways shall have been eventually
extended to the Yalu.</p>

<p class='c032'>“11. This Agreement to supplant all previous Agreements
between Japan and Russia respecting Korea.”<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c014'><sup>[631]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen from this note that Japan made
several important concessions. These naturally fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>under three classes: concessions made to an expressed
wish of Russia; those in which desires of
Russia were changed from a one-sided into a reciprocal
form; and those made voluntarily on the
part of Japan. To the first class belongs the free
passage of the Korean Straits (Article 5), while the
neutralization of territory on both sides of the
northern frontier (Article 6), and the mutual declaration
that Korea was beyond the sphere of the
“special” interests of Russia, and Manchuria of Japan
(Article 7), may be said to fall under the second
class. Purely voluntary concessions may be said to
consist of the tenth Article regarding the Eastern
Chinese and Korean Railways meeting on the Yalu,
and a part of the eighth Article, in which the
“special” interests—not necessarily in the railway
work alone, as in the first Japanese note—of Russia
in Manchuria were unequivocally recognized.
Other Articles are largely identical with those of the
first note, except the new ninth Article, which embodied
the matter-of-fact principle that the treaty
rights of Russia in Korea, and of Japan in Manchuria,
should be mutually respected. Taken as a
whole—with the only exception regarding the preponderating
interests of Japan in Korea, and the
natural wishes of Japan arising from this peculiar
situation, the former of which had been wholly,<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c014'><sup>[632]</sup></a>
and the latter partially,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c014'><sup>[633]</sup></a> recognized by Russia—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>prevailing characteristic of the second Japanese
note may be said to be its reciprocal nature. The
special interests of Russia<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c014'><sup>[634]</sup></a> in Manchuria counterbalanced
the preponderant interests of Japan in
Korea,<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c014'><sup>[635]</sup></a> and each other’s right to take necessary
measures to protect those interests was recognized.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c014'><sup>[636]</sup></a>
At the same time, Manchuria was declared as far
beyond the sphere of Japanese special interests as
was Korea of the Russian,<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c014'><sup>[637]</sup></a> while, on the other
hand, the treaty rights of Russia in Korea, and
of Japan in Manchuria, were to be respected as a
matter of course.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c014'><sup>[638]</sup></a> If Russia was requested not to
impede the economic activity of the Japanese in
Korea,<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c014'><sup>[639]</sup></a> Japan also agreed not to fortify the Korean
coast.<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c014'><sup>[640]</sup></a> The case of the neutral zone<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c014'><sup>[641]</sup></a> need not
be repeated. In spite, however, of the reciprocal
nature of the note, it is unnecessary to say, so
long as the control of the Eastern policy of Russia
remained in the same hands as before, she could
hardly be expected to acquiesce in the Japanese
proposals.<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c014'><sup>[642]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>As has been said, the second note was handed
by Baron Komura to Baron Rosen on October 30.
To this note, after a repeated application from
Japan for a speedy answer,<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c014'><sup>[643]</sup></a> Russia replied only on
December 11, or more than forty days after the
receipt of the Japanese note. This second reply of
Russia<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c014'><sup>[644]</sup></a> was as much a reduction of her former concessions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>as was the second note of Japan an increase
upon hers; for Russia was now entirely silent on
the subject of Manchuria, and, regarding Korea,
repeated the restrictions proposed in September, as
if the second Japanese note had never reached her,
besides refusing to recognize Japan’s right to give
Korea anything beyond mere advice for the reform
of her civil administration. In short, the second
counter-note was equivalent to the first <em>minus</em> the
clauses regarding Manchuria and Japan’s right to
assist Korea in the latter’s reform. The possibility
of a reconciliation of the views of the two Powers
now appeared remoter than before. If the exact
contents of the reply had been publicly shown to
the Japanese people, it would have been extremely
difficult for the Katsura Cabinet to control their
resentment against what would have been regarded
under the circumstances as a deliberate insult to
their country.</p>

<p class='c007'>After another meeting of the Cabinet members
and Councilors on the 16th, Baron Komura made
one more attempt to appeal to the friendly sentiment
of the Russian Government. The nature of the
third Japanese overture will be seen from the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>dispatch, telegraphed by the Baron to Mr.
Kurino on the 21st:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“In my interview with the Russian Minister on December
21, I pointed out that, between our original proposals
and the new Russian counter-proposals, there was
a fundamental difference concerning the geographical
sphere of the understanding. After fully explaining how
the Imperial Government had come to consider it desirable,
in the general interest, to include in the proposed
understanding all the regions in the Extreme East where
the interests of the two Empires met, I expressed the
hope that the Russian Government would reconsider
their position regarding that branch of the question. I
also informed him, in detail, of the amendments which
the Imperial Government considered it necessary to
introduce into Russia’s new counter-proposals. Accordingly,
in order to remove every possibility of misunderstanding
on the part of Russia respecting the attitude
of the Imperial Government, you are instructed to
deliver to Count Lamsdorff a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">note verbale</span></i> to the following
effect:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Imperial Government have examined with
great care the new Russian counter-proposals of the 11th
instant. They regret that the Russian Government did
not agree to extend the compass of the suggested understanding
over the territory whose inclusion was deemed
essential by Japan.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Imperial Government, in their original proposition
to the Russian Government in August last, endeavored
to make it entirely clear that they desired, with
a view to remove from the Japanese-Russian relations
every cause for future misunderstanding, to bring within
the purview of the proposed arrangement all those regions
in the Extreme East where the interests of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Empires met. They cannot believe that a full realization
of that desire could be expected if a large and important
section of those regions was wholly excluded from the
understanding. Accordingly, the Imperial Government
feel constrained to ask the Russian Government to reconsider
their position on the subject, and they hope that
the Russian Government will be able to see their way
to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the question.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>MR. KURINO<br /><br /><em>Late Japanese Minister at St. Petersburg</em></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Imperial Government also find it necessary to
ask for the following amendments to the new Russian
counter-proposals:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘<em>a.</em> <span class='sc'>Article II.</span> to read: Recognition by Russia of
Japan’s preponderating interests in Korea, and of the
right of Japan to give Korea advice and assistance tending
to improve the administration of the Korean Empire;</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘<em>b.</em> <span class='sc'>Article V.</span> to read: Mutual engagement not to
undertake on the Korean coast any military works capable
of menacing the freedom of navigation in the Korean
Straits; and</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘<em>c.</em> <span class='sc'>Article VI.</span> to be suppressed.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘Not only as the main points of these amendments
cannot be said to be in excess of the modifications which
were agreed to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad referendum</span></i> at Tokio, but also as the
Imperial Government considered those changes indispensable,
it is believed that they will receive the ready
agreement of the Russian Government.’</p>

<p class='c032'>“In presenting the foregoing note to Count Lamsdorff,
you will say that I have spoken to Minister Rosen in a
similar sense, and you will also express the desire for a
prompt reply.”<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c014'><sup>[645]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Kurino carried out his instructions on December
23, and telegraphed on the same day to
Baron Komura: “... He [Count Lamsdorff]
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>told me he had received a telegram from Minister
Rosen, stating that the latter had had an interview
with Baron Komura, and that particulars would
follow; but such particulars had not yet been
received by him [the Count.]<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c014'><sup>[646]</sup></a> When I handed
him the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">note verbale</span></i>, he received it, and said that
he would do his best to send the Russian answer
at the earliest possible date; but added that he
would have to communicate with Viceroy Alexieff.
In conclusion I stated to the Count that, under
existing circumstances, it might cause serious difficulties,
even complications, if we failed to come to
an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</span></i>, and I hoped he would exercise his best
influence so as to enable us to reach the desired
end.”<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c014'><sup>[647]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When Minister Kurino saw Count Lamsdorff on
January 1, 1904, the latter, as he had been persistently
doing during the past few days, remarked
that he saw no reason why an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</span></i> could not
be arrived at, for Minister Rosen would soon be
instructed to proceed with the negotiations in a
friendly and conciliatory spirit.<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c014'><sup>[648]</sup></a> Other statements
of the same pacific nature were frequently made, not
only by the Count, but also by the Czar, and were
circulated through the press and foreign telegraphic
service. When, however, the reply of Russia<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c014'><sup>[649]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>reached Tokio on January 6, it was found that here
again, as in the first reply of September last, the
recognition by Japan of Manchuria and its coast
as beyond her sphere of interest—the word “special”
not preceding the last word—was insisted
upon, while, as before, no mention was made of the
territorial integrity of China in Manchuria. As
regards the equal opportunity for the enterprise
of other nations, it should be noted that Russia
now agreed to insert a clause not to obstruct the
enjoyment by Japan and other Powers of the treaty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>rights which they had acquired from China in regard
to Manchuria, but only on the condition of
maintaining the clauses on the neutral zone in
Korea and the non-employment by Japan of any
part of Korea for strategical purposes. Moreover,
the treaty rights of other Powers in Manchuria,
which Russia would respect, explicitly excluded those
concerning the foreign settlements in the open
ports,<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c014'><sup>[650]</sup></a> thus again evincing her exclusive policy.
Over and above these considerations, it should be
remembered that, as has been pointed out by Baron
Komura,<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c014'><sup>[651]</sup></a> the treaty rights which China had accorded
to other Powers could not be maintained if her
sovereignty in Manchuria, the existence of which
Russia declined to assure Japan that she would respect,
should cease.<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c014'><sup>[652]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>In a few days there took place an important
event which made the Russian position untenable.
The Chinese-American<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c014'><sup>[653]</sup></a> and Chinese-Japanese<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c014'><sup>[654]</sup></a> commercial
treaties which had been concluded on October
8, 1903,<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c014'><sup>[655]</sup></a> the date appointed for the final evacuation
of Manchuria, were ratified on January
11, 1904, the former opening to the world’s trade
Mukden and An-tung, and the latter, Mukden and
Tatung-kao, thus not only multiplying the treaty
rights, including rights of foreign settlements, of
Japan and the United States in Manchuria, but
also forcibly reinstating the sovereign rights of
the Chinese Empire in the territory, and directly
reversing the exclusive claims of Russia therein.
It will be recalled that Russia had recently seized
Mukden, and had been strengthening her forces
upon the Yalu, on which the other two new ports
were situated. The United States Government,
immediately upon the ratification of the treaty,
appointed Consuls for the three new open ports.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to the Russo-Japanese negotiations.
Thus far notes and replies, exchanged three times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>within a period of five months, must have made the
position of each negotiating Power perfectly clear
to the other. No further discussion could possibly
bring the two Governments nearer to a reconciliation
of wishes so diametrically opposed. In the
mean time, the Japanese people were suffering from
enormous economic losses. A large part of their
raw materials had ceased to come, the shipping and
trade with Korea and Northern China had declined,
the fishing industry had been paralyzed, and, contrary
to the tendency at normal times, the banks
had been embarrassed with an over-abundance of
funds.<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c014'><sup>[656]</sup></a> On the other hand, Russia, while circulating
the optimistic views of her Emperor and Foreign
Minister, had continued her sharp diplomacy
at Seul and Peking, and pushed on land and sea
her vast warlike preparations in the East.<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c014'><sup>[657]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Even then the Japanese Government would not
terminate its negotiations with Russia, for it was
well aware that upon the conduct of these negotiations
the peace of the East depended. If the principles
proposed by Japan were not accepted, the
integrity of China would be threatened, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>independence of Korea, as well as the vital interest
of Japan, would be profoundly endangered; thus
the entire future of the Far East would be plunged
into unknown perils. Under these circumstances,
it seemed that Japan owed to the world as much of
patience, as she owed to herself of determination.
The situation was gravely discussed by the statesmen
on the 11th, and before the Throne again
on the 12th.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c014'><sup>[658]</sup></a> On the next day, January 13, now
for the fourth time, and against the wishes of the
majority of the people, the Government of Tokio
reminded Russia of the serious position in which
the two Powers found themselves, and begged her
to reconsider the situation. Observe the following
telegram of the same date from Baron Komura to
Mr. Kurino:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“You are instructed to deliver to Count Lamsdorff the
following <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">note verbale</span></i> in order to confirm to him the views
I have communicated to Baron Rosen on the 13th January:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Imperial Government, with a view to arriving
at a pacific solution of the pending questions, and to
firmly establishing for all time the basis of good relations
between the two Powers, as well as to protect the rights
and interests of Japan, have, from this point of view,
given most careful and serious consideration to the reply
of the Russian Government which was delivered by his
Excellency Baron Rosen on the 26th instant. They have
finally come to the conclusion that the following modifications
are necessary, i. e.:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. ‘Suppression of the first clause of Article 5 of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>Russian counter-proposals (presented to the Japanese
Government through Baron Rosen on December 11),
that is to say, not to use any part of Korean territory for
strategical purposes.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. ‘Suppression of the whole Article (6) concerning
establishment of a neutral zone.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. ‘The Russian proposal concerning Manchuria
to be agreed to with the following modifications:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<em>a.</em> ‘Recognition by Japan of Manchuria and its littoral
as being outside her sphere of interest, and an engagement
on the part of Russia to respect the territorial
integrity of China in Manchuria.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<em>b.</em> ‘Russia, within the limits of Manchuria, will not
impede Japan nor other Powers in the enjoyment of rights
and privileges acquired by them under the existing treaties
with China.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<em>c.</em> ‘Recognition by Russia of Korea and its littoral as
being outside her sphere of interest.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. ‘Addition of an Article to the following effect:
Recognition by Japan of Russia’s special interests in
Manchuria, and of the right of Russia to take measures
necessary for the protection of those interests.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The grounds for these amendments having been
frequently and fully explained on previous occasions, the
Imperial Government do not think it necessary to repeat
the explanations, beyond expressing their earnest hope
for reconsideration by the Russian Government. It is
sufficient to say that the suppression of the clause excluding
the establishment of settlements in Manchuria is desired
because it conflicts with stipulations of the new
commercial treaty between Japan and China. In this
respect, however, Japan will be satisfied if she receives
equal treatment with other Powers which have already
acquired similar rights in regard to settlements....</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘Finally, the above-mentioned amendments being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>proposed by the Imperial Government entirely in a spirit
of conciliation, it is expected that they will be received
with the same spirit at the hands of the Russian Government;
and the Imperial Government further hope for an
early reply from the Russian Government, since further
delay in the solution of the question will be extremely
disadvantageous to the two countries.’”<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c014'><sup>[659]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An early reply was urged by Mr. Kurino at least
four times,<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c014'><sup>[660]</sup></a> but, even so late as February 1, Count
Lamsdorff declined even to name the date on which
his reply would be given;<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c014'><sup>[661]</sup></a> and, indeed, the reply<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c014'><sup>[662]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>which was being framed was found later to have
contained substantially the same points as the three
previous replies—points some of which had been
repeatedly and unequivocally demonstrated to be
entirely irreconcilable with the vital interests of
Japan. Just at this time, the activity of the Russian
forces in the East seemed to have been accelerated:
on January 21, numbers of infantry and
artillery left Port Arthur and Dalny for the Korean
frontier, soon to be followed by contingents from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Liao-yang; on the 28th, Viceroy Alexieff ordered
the troops on the Yalu to be placed upon a war
footing; on February 1, the Governor of Vladivostok
warned the Japanese Commercial Agent at the
port to prepare for withdrawing his compatriots to
Habarofsk, as he had received instructions from
his Government and was ready to proclaim martial
law at any time; and, on the 3d, all the war-vessels
located at Port Arthur, excepting one, steamed
out of the harbor.<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c014'><sup>[663]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was now considered by the Japanese Government
that the critical point had been reached. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Cabinet members and Privy Councilors held a conference
on February 3, and again, on the next day,
before the Throne. On February 5, at 2 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>,
two notes were telegraphed to Mr. Kurino, the one
communicating Japan’s decision to break off negotiations
which had not been met with proper consideration
and had become useless, and to reserve to
herself the right to pursue an independent course
of action, in order to safeguard her interests and
rights and to protect her position menaced by Russia;
and the other stating that Japan had been
obliged to sever her now valueless diplomatic relations
with the Russian Government. We subjoin
the entire texts of the telegraphic messages from
Baron Komura to Mr. Kurino inclosing the above-mentioned
notes:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Further prolongation of the present situation being
intolerable, the Imperial Government have decided to
terminate the pending negotiations, and to take such independent
action as they may deem necessary to defend
our position menaced by Russia, and to protect our rights
and interests. Accordingly you are instructed, immediately
upon receipt of this telegram, to address to Count
Lamsdorff the following signed note:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Undersigned, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan,
has the honor, in pursuance of instructions from his Government,
to address to His Excellency the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor of all the
Russias the following communications:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The Government of His Majesty the Emperor of
Japan regard the independence and territorial integrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of Korea as essential to the repose and safety of their own
country, and they are consequently unable to view with
indifference any action tending to render the position of
Korea insecure.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘The obstinate rejections by the Russian Government,
by means of amendments impossible of agreement,
of Japan’s proposals respecting Korea, the adoption of
which the Imperial Government regard as indispensable
to assure the existence of the Korean Empire and to
safeguard Japan’s preponderating interests in the peninsula;
and the obstinate refusals of Russia to enter into
an engagement to respect China’s territorial integrity in
Manchuria, which is seriously menaced by the continued
occupation of the province, notwithstanding Russia’s
treaty engagements with China and her repeated assurances
to other Powers possessing interests in those regions—have
made it necessary for the Imperial Government
seriously to consider what measures of self-defense they
are called upon to take.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘In spite of Russia’s repeated delays to reply without
intelligible reasons, and of her naval and military
activities, irreconcilable with pacific aims, the Imperial
Government have exercised during the present negotiations
a degree of forbearance which they believe affords
sufficient proof of their loyal desire to remove from their
relations with the Russian Government every cause for
future misunderstanding. But finding in their efforts
no prospect of securing from the Russian Government an
adhesion either to Japan’s moderate and unselfish proposals
or to any other proposals likely to establish a firm
and enduring peace in the Far East, the Imperial Government
have no other alternative than to terminate the
present futile negotiations.</p>

<p class='c032'>“‘In adopting this course, the Imperial Government

at Chemulpo two days later, followed by the naval
battle at Port Arthur on the night of February 8–9,
and, on the 10th, war was formally declared by
the Emperors of both Powers. The Russian Sovereign’s
manifesto, which appeared in the <cite>Official
Messenger</cite>, said:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“We proclaim to all our faithful subjects that, in our
solicitude for the preservation of that peace so dear to our
heart, we have put forth every effort to assure tranquillity
in the Far East. To these pacific ends we declared our
assent to the revision, proposed by the Japanese Government,
of the agreements existing between the two Empires
concerning Korean affairs. The negotiations initiated
on this subject were, however, not brought to a
conclusion, and Japan, not even awaiting the arrival of
our last reply and the proposals of our Government, informed
us of the rupture of the negotiations and of diplomatic
relations with Russia.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Without previously notifying us that the rupture of
such relations implied the beginning of warlike action, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Japanese Government ordered its torpedo-boats to make
a sudden attack on our squadron in the outer roadstead
of the fortress of Port Arthur. After receiving the report
of our Viceroy on the subject, we at once commanded
Japan’s challenge to be replied to by arms.</p>

<p class='c032'>“While proclaiming this our resolve, we, in unshakable
confidence in the help of the Almighty, and firmly
trusting in the unanimous readiness of all our faithful
subjects to defend the Fatherland together with ourselves,
invoke God’s blessing on our glorious forces of the army
and navy.”<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c014'><sup>[667]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Japanese Imperial Rescript, countersigned
by all the members of the Cabinet, and declaring
war against Russia, read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“We, by the Grace of Heaven, the Emperor of Japan,
seated on the Throne occupied by the same dynasty from
time immemorial, do hereby make proclamation to all
our loyal and brave subjects:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“We hereby declare war against Russia. We command
our army and navy to carry on hostilities against her with
all their strength, and we also command all our officials
to make effort, in pursuance of their duties and in accordance
with their powers, to attain the national aim, with
all the means within the limits of the law of nations.</p>

<p class='c032'>“We deem it essential to international relations, and
make it our constant aim, to promote the pacific progress
of our Empire in civilization, to strengthen our friendly
ties with other States, and thereby to establish a state of
things which would maintain enduring peace in the East,
and assure the future security of our Empire without
injury to the rights and interests of other Powers. Our

</div>

<p class='c032'>“It is thus entirely against our wishes that we have
unhappily come to open hostilities against Russia.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The integrity of Korea has long been a matter of
the gravest concern to our Empire, not only because of
the traditional relations between the two countries, but
because the separate existence of Korea is essential to the
safety of our Empire. Nevertheless, Russia, despite her
explicit treaty pledges to China and her repeated assurances
to other Powers, is still in occupation of Manchuria,
and has consolidated and strengthened her hold
upon it, and is bent upon its final absorption. Since the
possession of Manchuria by Russia would render it
impossible to maintain the integrity of Korea, and would,
in addition, compel the abandonment of all hope for peace
in the Far East, we expected, in these circumstances, to
settle the question by negotiations and secure thereby a
permanent peace. With this object in view, our officials
by our order made proposals to Russia, and frequent
conferences were held during the last half year. Russia,
however, never met such proposals in a spirit of conciliation,
but by her prolonged delays put off the settlement
of the pending question, and, by ostensibly advocating
peace on the one hand, and on the other secretly extending
her naval and military preparations, sought to bring
about our acquiescence. It is not possible in the least to
admit that Russia had from the first a sincere desire for
peace. She has rejected the proposals of our Empire;
the safety of Korea is in danger; the interests of our Empire
are menaced. At this crisis, the guarantees for the
future which the Empire has sought to secure by peaceful
negotiations can now only be sought by an appeal to
arms.</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>“It is our earnest wishes that, by the loyalty and valor
of our faithful subjects, peace may soon be permanently

<h3 class='c012'>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p class='c013'>In view of the singular circumstances under which the
war broke out, it would be a matter of permanent interest
to the student of international law to observe the
difference of opinion which arose between the contending
Powers respecting the legality of opening hostilities before
war was formally declared, and also respecting the so-called
neutrality of Korea. We reproduce below, without
comment, the charges of Russia and replies of Japan regarding
these subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>On February 18, the Russian Government issued the
following official <em>communiqué</em>:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Eight days have now elapsed since all Russia was
shaken with profound indignation against an enemy
who suddenly broke off negotiations, and, by a treacherous
attack, endeavored to obtain an easy success in a
war long desired. The Russian nation, with natural impatience,
desires prompt vengeance, and feverishly awaits
news from the Far East. The unity and strength of the
Russian people leave no room for doubt that Japan will
receive the chastisement she deserves for her treachery
and her provocation of war at a time when our beloved
Sovereign desired to maintain peace among all nations.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The conditions under which hostilities are being carried
on compel us to wait with patience for news of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>success of our troops, which cannot occur before decisive
actions have been fought by the Russian army. The distance
of the territory now attacked and the desire of the
Czar to maintain peace were causes of the impossibility
of preparations for war being made a long time in advance.
Much time is now necessary in order to strike at
Japan blows worthy of the dignity and might of Russia,
and, while sparing as much as possible the shedding of
blood of her children, to inflict just chastisement on the
nation which has provoked the struggle.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Russia must await the event in patience, being sure
that our army will avenge that provocation a hundredfold.
Operations on land must not be expected for some
time yet, and we cannot obtain early news from the theatre
of war. The useless shedding of blood is unworthy of the
greatness and power of Russia. Our country displays
such unity and desire for self-sacrifice on behalf of the
national cause that all true news from the scene of hostilities
will be immediately due to the entire nation.”<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c014'><sup>[669]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On February 20, the <cite>Official Messenger</cite> published the
following account of the termination of the diplomatic
relations between the two Powers:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“On January 16, after receipt of the last Japanese
proposals, the Russian Imperial Government at once
proceeded to examine them. On January 25 Mr. Kurino,
the Japanese Minister at St. Petersburg, in reply to his
inquiry, was informed that the Czar had intrusted the
consideration of these proposals to a special conference,
which was to meet on January 28, and that his Majesty’s
decision would probably not be given before February 2.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c014'><sup>[670]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>On the last-named date the Czar gave orders to prepare
a draft of definite instructions for the Russian Minister
at Tokio on the basis of the deliberations of the special
conference. On the day following, three telegrams were
dispatched to Viceroy Alexieff, containing the full text of
a draft statement, the reasons which prompted the Russian
Government in making some modifications in the
Japanese proposals, and the general instructions for the
Russian Minister at Tokio concerning the presentation of
the reply to the Japanese Government. In order to save
time, identical telegrams were sent direct to Baron Rosen.</p>

<p class='c032'>“On February 4, forty-eight hours before the receipt
of the news of the rupture of diplomatic relations by
Japan, Count Lamsdorff notified the Japanese Minister of
the dispatch to Baron Rosen of the Russian proposals in
reply to the Japanese note.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c014'><sup>[671]</sup></a> On February 5, a message
arrived from the Viceroy stating that he had heard from
the Baron that the latter had received the Russian reply.
On the 6th, at four o’clock in the afternoon, the Japanese
Minister, quite unexpectedly, handed to the Russian Minister
of Foreign Affairs two notes, the first of which notified
the rupture of negotiations on the pretext that Russia
was evading a reply<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c014'><sup>[672]</sup></a> to the Japanese proposals, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>second announced the breaking off of diplomatic relations,
and added that the Japanese Minister, with the
staff of the Legation, would leave St. Petersburg on the
10th. These notes were accompanied by a private letter
from the Japanese Minister to Count Lamsdorff, in which
the hope was expressed that the rupture of diplomatic
relations would be confined to as short a time as possible.</p>

<p class='c032'>“On the same day, Admiral Alexieff, Baron Rosen, and
all the Russian Representatives in Peking, Tokio, and the
capitals of the great Powers were informed by urgent
telegrams of the rupture of diplomatic relations with
Japan and the issue of our Imperial order for the withdrawal
of the Russian Legation from Tokio. The said
circular dispatch laid the responsibility of all consequences
that might ensue on the Japanese Government.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c014'><sup>[673]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c032'>“Although the breaking off of diplomatic relations by
no means implies the opening of hostilities, the Japanese
Government, as early as the night of the 8th, and in the
course of the 9th and 10th, committed a whole series of
revolting attacks on Russian warships and merchantmen,
attended by a violation of international law. The decree
of the Emperor of Japan on the subject of the declaration
of war against Russia was not issued until the 11th instant.”<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c014'><sup>[674]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The substance of the reply of the Japanese Government
to these notes, of which the following is a free translation,
was made public through the press on March 3:—</p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“The Russian Government, by their notes published on
February 18 and 20, charged Japan with unexpectedly
attacking, and gaining a treacherous victory over, the
forces of Russia, a Power anxious to maintain peace,
and stated that the severance of diplomatic relations by
no means implied the opening of hostilities, and that,
although Japan declared war only on February 11, she
had since the 8th made revolting attacks upon Russian
war-vessels and merchantmen and conducted herself in
violation of principles of international law.</p>

<p class='c032'>“That, however, Russia did not sincerely desire
peace may be readily seen from the fact that she never
in any manner met the negotiations of Japan in a conciliatory
spirit, but put off the solution of the pending
question by prolonged delays, and, at the same time,
diligently extended her naval and military preparations.
Since Russia failed in April, 1903, to carry out her pledge
respecting the second part of her evacuation of Manchuria,
the facts concerning the increase of Russian
forces in the Far East have been as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“The following war-vessels were added:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Besides these, Russia sent by rail to Port Arthur
material for framing torpedo-destroyers, of which seven
had already been made, and armed two volunteer fleet
steamboats at Vladivostok and hoisted the naval flag
upon them.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Moreover, Russia dispatched one battleship, three
cruisers, seven torpedo-destroyers, and four torpedo-boats,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>aggregating about 37,040 tons, which were on their
way to the East. The total of all these vessels would therefore
reach the tonnage of about 113,000 tons.</p>

<p class='c032'>“As regards the increased land forces, Russia, beginning
with the two brigades of infantry, two battalions of
artillery, and certain numbers of cavalry and of the commissariat,
which she sent to China on June 29, 1903,
under the pretext of making experiment of the carrying
capacity of the Siberian Railway, continually dispatched
troops to the Far East, until there were already, at the
beginning of February of this year, more than 40,000
soldiers. Russia was further preparing to send, in case
of necessity, over 200,000 more soldiers.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Simultaneously, Russia hastened her work through
day and night in building new forts at the naval harbors
of Port Arthur and Vladivostok; repaired fortifications
at Kun-chun, Liao-yang, and other strategic points; sent
to the Far East by the volunteer fleet and the Siberian
Railway large quantities of arms and ammunition; and,
so early as the middle of October, 1903, fourteen trains
carrying field-hospital equipment left Russia in great
haste. From these data, one may conclude that Russia
had not the least desire for conciliation, but sought to
coerce Japan by force of arms.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The military activity of Russia was further accelerated
from the end of January. On the 21st of January,
about two battalions of the infantry and some of the
artillery were sent from Port Arthur and Talien to the
northern frontier of Korea; on the 28th, Viceroy Alexieff
ordered the Russian troops near the Yalu to be placed
on a war footing; on February 1, the Governor of Vladivostok
asked the Japanese Commercial Agent at the port
to prepare to withdraw to Habarofsk the Japanese subjects
residing there, as the Governor was, under instructions
from his Government, ready at any time to proclaim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>martial law; all the capable warships at Port
Arthur, except one battleship under repair, steamed out
to sea; and army forces were continually leaving Liao-yang
toward the Yalu. Who can say that Russia had
neither desire nor preparation for war? Under these
critical circumstances, rendering another day’s delay inadmissible,
Japan was compelled to break off the useless
negotiations and take necessary measures of self-protection.
The responsibility of provoking war does not rest
upon Japan, but, on the contrary, entirely upon Russia.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Moreover, Japan notified Russia, on February 6,
that she would terminate her negotiations with Russia,
and take such independent action as she deemed best in
order to defend her position menaced by Russia and protect
her interests, as well as that the diplomatic relations
with Russia were severed and the Japanese Legation
would withdraw from St. Petersburg. An independent
action implies all, including, as a matter of course, the
opening of hostile acts. Even if Russia were unable to
understand it, Japan had no reason to hold herself responsible
for the misunderstandings of Russia. The
students of the international law all agree that a declaration
of war is not a necessary condition for beginning
hostilities, and it has been customary in modern warfare
for the declaration to follow the opening of the war. The
action of Japan had, therefore, no ground for censure in
international law. It is singular that the censure should
come, as it did, from Russia, for historical instances are
not few in which she opened hostile acts without declaring
war. In 1808, she moved troops to Finland even before
diplomatic relations were severed.”<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c014'><sup>[675]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c030' />

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>By far the most important document containing Russian
charges against Japan was the following circular
addressed by Count Lamsdorff, on February 11, to the
Russian Representatives abroad:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Since the rupture of the negotiations between Russia
and Japan, the attitude of the Tokio Cabinet has constituted
an open violation of all customary laws governing
the mutual relations of civilized nations.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Without specifying each particular violation of these
laws on the part of Japan, the Imperial Government
considers it necessary to draw the most serious attention
of the Powers to the acts of violence committed by the
Japanese Government with respect to Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The independence and integrity of Korea, as a fully
independent Empire, have been fully recognized by all the
Powers, and the inviolability of this fundamental principle
was confirmed by Article 1 of the Shimonoseki
treaty, and by the agreement especially concluded for
this purpose between Japan and Great Britain on January
30, 1902, as well as by the Franco-Russian declaration
of March 16, 1902.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Emperor of Korea, foreseeing the danger of a
possible conflict between Russia and Japan, addressed,
early in January, 1904, a note to all the Powers, declaring
his determination to preserve the strictest neutrality.
This declaration was received with satisfaction by the
Powers, and it was ratified by Russia. According to the
Russian Minister to Korea, the British Government,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>which had signed the above-mentioned treaty with Japan
on January 30, 1902, charged the British diplomatic
Representative at Seul to present an official note to the
Emperor of Korea, thanking him for his declaration of
neutrality.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c014'><sup>[676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c032'>“In disregard of all these facts, in spite of all treaties,
in spite of its obligations, and in violation of the fundamental
rules of international law, it has been proved by
exact and fully confirmed facts that the Japanese Government,</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. Before the opening of hostilities against Russia,
landed its troops in the independent Empire of Korea,
which had declared its neutrality.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. With a division of its fleet made a sudden attack
on February 8—that is, three days prior to the
declaration of war—on two Russian warships in the
neutral port of Chemulpo. The commanders of these
ships had not been notified of the severance of diplomatic
relations, as the Japanese maliciously stopped the delivery
of Russian telegrams by the Danish cable and
destroyed the telegraphic communication of the Korean
Government. The details of this dastardly attack are
contained and published in an official telegram from the
Russian Minister at Seul.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. In spite of the international laws above mentioned,
and shortly before the opening of hostilities, the
Japanese captured as prizes of war certain Russian merchant
ships in the neutral ports of Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. Japan declared to the Emperor of Korea, through
the Japanese Minister at Seul, that Korea would henceforth
be under Japanese administration, and she warned
the Emperor that in case of his non-compliance, Japanese
troops would occupy the palace.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. Through the French Minister at Seul she summoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>the Russian Representative at the Korean Court
to leave the country, with the staffs of the Russian Legation
and Consulate.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Recognizing that all of the above facts constitute a
flagrant breach of international law, the Imperial Government
considers it to be its duty to lodge a protest
with all the Powers against this procedure of the Japanese
Government, and it is firmly convinced that all
the Powers, valuing the principles which guarantee their
relations, will agree with the Russian attitude.</p>

<p class='c032'>“At the same time, the Imperial Government considers
it necessary to issue a timely warning that, owing to
Japan’s illegal assumption of power in Korea, the Government
declares all orders and declarations which may
be issued on the part of the Korean Government to be
invalid.</p>

<p class='c032'>“I beg you to communicate this document to the Government

<p class='c007'>In reply to the above, the Japanese Government issued,
on March 9, the following statement:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Russian Government are understood to have
recently addressed a note to the Powers, in which the
Japanese Government are charged with having committed
certain acts in Korea which are considered by Russia to
be in violation of international law, and in which Russia
further declares all future orders and declarations of the
Korean Government to be invalid.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Imperial Government do not find it necessary in
the present instance to concern themselves in any way

<p class='c032'>“Accordingly, the Imperial Government desire to make
the following statement respecting the five acts which are
declared, in the Russian note above referred to, to be
fully proved and confirmed facts:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“1. The Imperial Government admit that a number of
Japanese troops landed in Korea before the formal declaration
of war was issued by Japan, but they must say
that such landing did not take place before a state of war
actually existed between Japan and Russia. The maintenance
of the independence and territorial integrity of
Korea is one of the objects of war, and, therefore, the
dispatch of troops to the menaced territory was a matter
of right and necessity, which, moreover, had the distinct
consent of the Korean Government. The Imperial
Government, therefore, drew a sharp distinction between
the landing of the Japanese troops in Korea in the
actual circumstances of the case and the sending of
large bodies of Russian troops to Manchuria without the
consent of China while peaceful negotiations were still in
progress.</p>

<p class='c032'>“2. The Imperial Government declare that the Russian
allegation that they stopped the delivery of Russian
telegrams by the Danish cable and destroyed the Korean
Government’s telegraphic communication is wholly
untrue. No such acts were done by the Imperial Government.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Regarding the alleged sudden attack, on February 8
last, upon two Russian men-of-war in the port of Chemulpo,
it is only necessary to say that a state of war then
existed, and that, Korea having consented to the landing
of Japanese troops at Chemulpo, that harbor had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>ceased to be a neutral port, at least as between the belligerents.</p>

<p class='c032'>“3. The Imperial Government have established a
Prize Court, with full authority to pronounce finally on
the question of the legality of seizures of merchant vessels.
Accordingly, they deem it manifestly out of place
to make any statement on their part regarding the Russian
assertion that they unlawfully captured as prizes of
war the Russian merchantmen which were in the ports
of Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“4. The Russian Government allege that the Japanese
Government declared to the Emperor of Korea through
their Minister at Seul that Korea would henceforth be
under Japanese administration, and warned the Emperor
that, in case of non-compliance, Japanese troops
would occupy the palace. The Imperial Government
declare this charge to be absolutely and wholly without
foundation.</p>

<p class='c032'>“5. No demand, either direct or indirect, was addressed
by the Japanese Government to the Russian Minister at
Seul to retire from Korea. The fact is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“On February 10 last, the French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé d’Affaires</span></i>
at Seul called on the Japanese Minister there and informed
him, as it was confirmed afterwards in writing,
that it was the desire of the Russian Minister to leave
Korea, and asked the opinion of the Japanese Minister
on the subject. The Japanese Minister replied that, if
the Russian Minister would withdraw in a peaceful
manner, taking with him his staff and the Legation guard,
he would be fully protected by Japanese troops. So he
withdrew of his own free will on the 12th of the same
month, and an escort of Japanese soldiers was furnished
for him as far as Chemulpo.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c014'><sup>[678]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“The Russian allegation that the Japanese Government
forwarded a summons through the French Representative
in Korea to the Russian Minister to leave
Korea is, therefore, not true. In this connection it may
be remarked that the Russian Consul at Fusan remained
at his post as late as until February 28 last. It is reported
that he was compelled to stay so long owing to the absence
of instructions which the Russian Minister apparently
did not think of giving to the Consul before his own
departure from Seul. When it was known that necessary
instructions had at last reached the Russian Consul, and
that he desired to leave Fusan as soon as possible, the
Japanese Consul at the same port offered him every facility
for the departure, and his passage to Shanghai <em>via</em>
Japan was arranged by the Japanese Consul.”<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c014'><sup>[679]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In reply to the above, the Russian Government issued
another statement justifying its position, the purport of
which may be gathered from the following press dispatch:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>St. Petersburg</span>, March 12—2:50 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> The following
reply, inspired by the Foreign Office, to Japan’s
rejoinder to the Russian protest against the violation of
Korean neutrality may be accepted as official:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Japan’s argument that she was justified in landing
troops in Korea before the declaration of war because she
had Korea’s permission, and also that these troops arrived
in Korea after ‘the existence of a state of war,’ is without
value, as Korea in January promulgated her neutrality to
the Powers, which received it warmly, Great Britain even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>officially conveying expressions of gratitude to the Korean
Government. Therefore, no state of war gave the Japanese
the right to violate her neutrality by landing troops in
her territory. Even the consent of Korea, though extorted
by the Japanese, is without force, from the fact that the
dispatch of troops was not only before the war, but before
the breaking off of diplomatic relations, as clearly established
and indeed acknowledged by the Japanese themselves.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Japan’s contention in defense of the attack on the
Russian ships at Chemulpo, that the port was not neutral
on February 9, is false, again because Korea had proclaimed
her neutrality.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Japan’s denial of malicious interference with the transmission
of Russian telegrams over the Danish cable cannot
be sustained. A telegram to Baron Rosen (then Russian
Minister to Japan), at Tokio, sent from St. Petersburg
February 4, was not delivered till the morning of
February 7. That delay did not occur on the Siberian
line, as was shown by the fact that a reply to a telegram
from Viceroy Alexieff sent at the same time was received
the same day. Therefore, it is conclusive that the Rosen
telegram was held by the Japanese and not delivered for
two days.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Communication with M. Pavloff (then Russian Minister
to Korea) by the Korean telegraph ceased in the middle
of January. As the Koreans were enjoying friendly
relations with Russia, there is good ground for believing
that the interruption was due to the Japanese. Thereafter
M. Pavloff used a mail steamer or a special warship
to communicate with Port Arthur. The Minister of Russia
at Seul February 8, therefore, knew nothing of the
diplomatic rupture.</p>

<p class='c032'>“Japan pleads that the charge against her seizure of
Russian merchantmen before the declaration of war cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>lie after the establishment of prize courts. Their seizure
before the declaration of war being piracy is not defensible
by the establishment of prize courts, which cannot
exist before a declaration of war. The steamer ‘Russia’
was seized in the waters of Southern Korea even before
M. Kurino had presented his note here.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The reply concludes: ‘Our information regarding
Japan’s announcement that in future Korea would be
under her administration came from M. Pavloff and also
from the Representative of a friendly Power at Seul.
Japan’s denial, consequently, is fruitless, as also is the
attempt to refute our statement that the Russian Minister
and Consul at Seul were told to leave. We had conclusive
proof in St. Petersburg on February 10 that the French
Minister at Seul had officially notified our Representatives
that the Japanese Government had intimated that
they should leave, and that the Japanese had occupied
territory in Korea. M. Pavloff was unable to notify our
Consul at Fusan, his telegram being refused at the telegraph
office.’”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>CHINESE NEUTRALITY AND KOREAN INTEGRITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No sooner had the war broken out than the
Japanese Government notified other Powers, on
February 9, that it had advised the Chinese Government
to observe a strict neutrality during hostilities.
Below is a translation of the identical note
addressed on that day by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs to the Japanese Representatives at London,
Washington, Paris, Vienna, and Rome:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Imperial Government have carefully considered
the question as to what attitude China should assume to
the best advantage, in case Japan and Russia should go
to war. The conflict between Japan and Russia would
affect the interests of China at least to the same extent
that it would those of Japan, and the Imperial Government
also fully recognize the advantage of utilizing for
their aims the resources of China, so immense in population
and material. But, on the other hand, they
cannot overlook what effects would ensue should China
assume a hostile attitude [in favor of Japan]. Such an
attitude would probably plunge the finances of China into
a still greater confusion [than at present], and, if it did
not incapacitate her, it would render it difficult for her
to meet her obligations. Her foreign trade would also
suffer unfortunate results. There, however, exists an even
greater apprehension, namely, that it is not unlikely that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>thereby an anti-foreign feeling might again be aroused
in China, and the Powers of the world might be obliged
to encounter troubles similar to those of 1900. For
these reasons, the Imperial Government have advised
the Chinese Government that, in case Japan and Russia
should go to war, they should observe neutrality, and
should take all possible measures to maintain order and
peace within their Empire.</p>

<p class='c032'>“You are instructed to address a signed communication
to this effect to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
the Government to which you are accredited, and also
assure him that, if China maintains her neutrality, and
so long as Russia respects it, the Imperial Government
will likewise respect it.”<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c014'><sup>[680]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Three days after this note was issued, the United
States Minister at Tokio, Mr. Griscom, delivered
the circular note of Secretary Hay urging on the
belligerent Powers the advisability of respecting the
neutrality and maintaining the administrative entity
of China, and of limiting the zone of hostilities in
the Chinese territory. The note, arriving as it did,
after the Japanese attitude had been clearly defined,
Baron Komura at once replied, on the 13th, that
the Japanese Government were in perfect accord
with the United States Government in the desires
expressed by the latter, and would, so long as Russia
made the same pledge and faithfully observed
it, promise to respect the neutrality and the administrative
entity of the Chinese Empire beyond regions
actually in Russian occupation. The result of the
correspondence between the United States and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Powers regarding Mr. Hay’s circular further confirmed
the views expressed in Japan’s reply, for the
neutral rights of China could hardly be enforced
in Manchuria, or, in other words, the zone of war
would be best limited to that territory. These points
were agreed to by the Powers, including Germany,
whose Emperor had appealed<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c014'><sup>[681]</sup></a> to the Government
of Washington to take the initiative in this general
agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Japanese note of February 9 and the general
agreement of the Powers secured by the United
States thus confirmed each other, the former establishing
the principle of neutrality and the latter
defining the geographical limit of its application.
The latter point, however, involved a debatable
problem, the solution of which was left to China
herself. It will be remembered that Japan, in her
reply of February 13 to the United States, mentioned,
as the field for hostile action, not all Manchuria,
but only the territory actually occupied by
Russian forces. This territory naturally excluded
that portion of Manchuria lying west of the Liao
River which Russian troops evacuated before October
8, 1902. The Chinese Government, in declaring
the neutrality of the Empire on the 13th, practically
confirmed the construction of the Japanese
Foreign Office, for, in her declaration, China announced
her intention, which has since been carried
out by Viceroy Yuan and General Ma, of dispatching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>forces to the west of the Liao River from which
the Russian forces had withdrawn, in order to defend
it against the incursion of troops of either
belligerent.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c014'><sup>[682]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>All the essential points regarding China’s neutrality
having been settled to the satisfaction of
Japan, the Government of the latter was in a position
to reply in the following manner, on February
17, to the Chinese declaration of the 13th:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“It being the desire of the Imperial Government to
prevent disturbance of peaceful conditions within the
Chinese Empire, they will, in all the Chinese dominion
outside the territory under Russian occupation, and so
long as Russia acts likewise, respect the neutrality of the
Empire.... Japan’s hostilities against Russia having
been actuated, not by a desire for conquest, but solely
by the necessity of defending her just rights and interests,
the Imperial Government have not the slightest intention
of acquiring territory, as a result of the war, at the expense
of China. It is also desired that the Chinese Government
will clearly understand that the [warlike] measures
to be taken [by Japan] in the field of action within
the Chinese territory, arising, as they will, purely from
military necessities, will not be of a nature to infringe
the sovereign rights of the Chinese Empire....”<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c014'><sup>[683]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c030' />

<p class='c007'>Ten days after Japan disavowed aggressive intentions
in Manchuria, on February 27, was published
the new Korean-Japanese Protocol,<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c014'><sup>[684]</sup></a> concluded on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>the 23d, whereby Japan pledged herself to guarantee
for all time the independence and the territorial
integrity of the Korean Empire. The text of
this remarkable document, in its English translation,
is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“Gonsuke Hayashi, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan,
and Major General Yi Chi-yong, Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad interim</span></i> of His Majesty the Emperor
of Korea, being, respectively, duly empowered for the
purpose, have agreed upon the following Articles:—</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 1.</span> For the purpose of maintaining a permanent
and unalterable friendship between Japan and
Korea, and of firmly establishing peace in the East, the
Imperial Government of Korea shall place full confidence
in the Imperial Government of Japan and adopt the
advice of the latter regarding improvements in administration.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 2.</span> The Imperial Government of Japan shall,
in a spirit of firm friendship, insure the safety and repose
of the Imperial House of Korea.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 3.</span> The Imperial Government of Japan
firmly guarantee the independence and the territorial
integrity of the Korean Empire.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 4.</span> In case the welfare of the Imperial House
of Korea, or the territorial integrity of Korea, is endangered
by the aggression of a third Power, or internal disturbances,
the Imperial Government of Japan shall immediately
take such necessary measures as circumstances
require, and in such case the Imperial Government of
Korea shall give full facilities to promote the action of
the Imperial Japanese Government.</p>

<p class='c032'>“The Imperial Government of Japan may, for the attainment
of the above-mentioned object, occupy, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>circumstances require it, such places as may be necessary
from the strategic point of view.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 5.</span> The Government of the two countries
shall not, in the future, without mutual consent, conclude
with a third Power such an arrangement as may
be contrary to the principles of the present Protocol.</p>

<p class='c032'>“<span class='sc'>Article 6.</span> Details in connection with the present
Protocol shall be arranged as the circumstances may
require between the Representative of Japan and the
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Korea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to imagine in the history of the
Russo-Japanese conflict a more striking indication
of the new situation it has opened than this Protocol
of February 23, 1904. It is at once a culmination
of past events and a background for future
activities. It sums up the failures of the past experience
and calls forth innumerable new problems
and difficulties. It will be seen, in the first place,
that the agreement is limited by no fixed term; it
exists for all time. Then the fundamental problem
of the Japanese-Korean relations is revealed here in
this Protocol in a clear outline, and is solved in the
most logical manner. The problem may be stated
thus: Japan’s interest and conviction demand that
Korea should be independent, prosperous, and
powerful; but Korea neither could nor would be so.
One remembers how Japan had struggled to solve
this problem, ever since she overthrew the feudal
régime of her own Government in 1868 and entered
upon a new career as a nation. At first, in 1876,
she declared Korea independent, and opened a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>of her ports to the world’s trade. Korea did not desire
and China could not tolerate the independence.
The result was the war of 1894–5, which succeeded
in forcing the independence of Korea. The latter,
however, proved neither more desirous nor more
capable of an independent career than she was under
Chinese sovereignty, while at the time China’s position
was merely replaced by that of a more active
Power, Russia. Japan seemed, after her costly war,
which, it is not too much to say, alone had earned
the sovereign rights of Korea, to acquiesce in the
altered situation to such an extent as to admit
Russia into a partnership with herself in the nonintervention
in Korea.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c014'><sup>[685]</sup></a> Bitter was Japan’s experience
in this artificial arrangement. Korea would
not strive for a freer life any more than Russia
would abstain from incessant interference.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c014'><sup>[686]</sup></a> Thus
the conviction was every year more forcibly and
painfully impressed upon Japan’s mind that the
threatening situation in the East arose from the two
fundamental defects of the existing arrangement:
first, Korea’s independence would be illusory so
long as her administrative system remained, as it
did, corrupt to the core, but no reform would result
from a system of non-interference; second, no joint
reform in Korea would be possible so long as one
of the contracting parties to the agreements of 1896
and 1898 found in Korea’s decay the source of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>influence over her. In short, in order to guard the
common interests of Japan and Korea, the former
would be constrained to reform the latter even
against her will; and, again, in order to effect a
thoroughgoing reform, Japan would be obliged to
part ways with Russia in Korea. One half of the
Russo-Japanese negotiations in 1903–4 hinged on
Japan’s desire for a free hand in Korea in the interest
of reform. The negotiations having failed,
and Russia having withdrawn from Korea, Japan
suddenly found herself alone with the latter, and
hastened to conclude with her an agreement which
seemed to embody the only possible logical solution
of the great historic problem of the Japanese-Korean
relations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us look this solution more squarely in the
face. Japan’s ardent desire for the independence
and strength of Korea, as a means of insuring the
mutual benefit of the two Powers and of establishing
a lasting peace in the East, would seem to constitute
the guiding principle of the entire document.
The historic inability of Korea to be independent
and strong is met in three different methods, each
one of which will not fail to bring about far-reaching
consequences. In the first place, the political
influence of a third Power is absolutely excluded
(Article 5), for the latter’s interest might lie in the
direction of the dependence and weakness of Korea.
In the second place, Japan alone guarantees, for all
time, the security and repose of the reigning house
of Korea and the independence and territorial integrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>of the Empire (Articles 2 and 3). For the
practical execution of this principle, Japan further
pledges herself to defend Korea from dangers, and
Korea in return allows to Japan necessary strategic
facilities (Article 4). Finally, and immediately the
most important of all, Japan undertakes to institute
reforms in Korea, for which she shall be invested
with the full confidence of Korea (Article 1). These
three important methods, it is needless to repeat,
are subservient to the central principle: the independence
and integrity of Korea. This large issue
must always prevail over minor incidents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming still nearer to the practical side of the
Protocol, it is not difficult to see that, of the three
methods already explained, one stands out as the
most important and most difficult,—the reform.
No greater burden and no more delicate work for
a nation can be imagined than that of regenerating
another whose nobility has grown powerful under
corruption, and whose lower classes do not desire
a higher existence. On the other hand, the inertia
and resistance of Korea would be tremendous, in
which her “full confidence” would give place to
hatred and rancor. The proverbial machinations of
the peninsular politicians would be set in motion in
all their speed and confusion. It would not be surprising
if, under the circumstances, even a military
control of Korea of a temporary and mild nature
should become necessary in order to cure her malady
and set her house in order. On the other hand,
when the necessary reform should be so deep and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>wide as is required in the present instance, the
temptation of the reformer would be great, and the
suspicion of the reformed even greater, where political
reformatory enterprises border upon the economic.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c014'><sup>[687]</sup></a>
Here and everywhere, Japan would save
herself from the gravest of errors, in spite of her
best intention in the large issue, only by the severest
self-control and consummate tact. Great is the penalty
of Japan that arises from her peculiar position.
She has never encountered in her long history a
greater trial of her moral force as a nation than in
the new situation opened by the Protocol. As to
the world at large, it will look forward to an intensely
interesting experiment of human history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the three great divisions of Japan’s markets, Europe sells
her machineries and articles of general consumption, and buys
in return such peculiar products of her soil as silks and teas.
East Asia, including India and the southern islands, takes coal
and manufactured goods in general and furnishes cotton, food-stuffs,
and other articles of more direct need than the European
goods. America occupies a unique position in regard to Japan,
as it combines to a large extent the peculiarities of both Europe

machinery and goods of general consumption, and imports from

<p class='c007'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. The direct import trade of any trading nation at Niu-chwang
does not represent the actual amount of the articles imported
from the country of that nation, for most of the foreign goods
come to Niu-chwang through some other distributing centres in
China, such as Hong-kong or Shanghai. The Japanese goods,
however, are nearly all carried by Japanese vessels. On the contrary,
the American imports, besides jeans, drills, sheetings, kerosenes,
and flour, are not specified in the customs returns of Niu-chwang,
and consequently their nominal figures are insignificant
(7396 <em>l.</em> in 1901 and 4089 <em>l.</em> in 1902), while Hong-kong, through
which most of the American goods are imported into Niu-chwang,
showed, in 1902, 385,302 <em>l.</em>, or 55 per cent. of the entire direct
trade. On the other hand, the estimate made by the Bureau of
Statistics, Department of Commerce and Labor, Washington,

the comparative numbers of men and women there should not

thirty-one miles from both ends had been built. In view of the
immense economic and strategic importance of the line, the
Japanese Government, which had for a certain period of time
guaranteed 6 per cent. annual interest on 25,000,000 <em>yen</em>, which
was fixed as the minimum capital of the company, now further
promoted its work by liberal measures, so as to make it possible

provinces of Korea, which comprise nearly seven tenths of all
the houses in the Empire, and cover more than five sevenths of
the cultivated area of the country, with considerable capacity
for future cultivation and improvement. The road also connects
places to which the Koreans flock from neighboring regions for
the periodical fairs held there. These fairs occur six times each
month, held alternately in different places, besides great annual
fairs in large cities. Among the thirty-nine stations of this railroad,

passengers and merchandise through the road will be considerable.
It is safe to say that five sevenths of the entire Korean
foreign trade belong to the sphere controlled by this line, and
also that nearly all of this trade is in reality the fast growing
Japan-Korea trade. The effect of the completion of the line upon
this trade will be tremendous. See Mr. J. Shinobu’s <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Kan Hantō</span></cite>

the Korean population cannot be much below 12,000,000. The

year after the harvest, or to deliver to the proprietor 50 per cent.
of the crop. It should always be remembered that a large majority
of actual cultivators are tenants, the proprietors being limited
to a small class of rich men, officers, and nobles. The daily wage
of the laborer on the farm averages 20 <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">sen</span></i>, but it is usually paid
in kind, as are debts and repayments in many cases. The standard
of life of the Korean farmer is perhaps lower than that of
the Japanese, but apparently not less comfortable. The national
land tax is said to be mild and largely discarded, but the house
tax, special tax, local tax, and the like, bring up the dues of the
farmer sometimes to an unendurable extent. The tenant, after
paying his rent and other charges, is obliged to sell what little
rice is left to him at the earliest opportunity, so that he henceforth
becomes a buyer of rice, and consequently has little to buy
other articles with, and still less to save, until his spring harvest
of wheat comes in. Woe betide him when both the rice and the
wheat crops fail! See the <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Kokumin</span></cite>, January 13 and 14, 1904,

<p class='c007'><a href='#r69'>69</a>. The Russia-China trade began more than 250 years ago.
Before 1860, it was carried wholly on land, and its balance was
nearly even. Since 1860, when sea trade from Odessa was
opened, the progress of this trade has been slower than the general
foreign trade of China, and its balance has been heavily
against Russia (6,702,000 against 45,945,000 rubles in 1900).
More than half of the Russian imports into China consists of
cotton fabrics, and over 80 per cent. of the exports from China
to Russia are teas. Russia’s share in the entire foreign trade of
China has also fallen from 4.6 per cent. in 1899 to 4.4 per cent.
in 1900, 2.6 per cent. in 1901, and 2.3 per cent. in 1902, as compared
with the growing share of the trade by Japan amounting
to 14.2 per cent., 15.9 per cent., 15.7 per cent., and 18.4 per cent.,
in those respective years. Of the Russian share of 2.6 per cent.
in 1901, Russian Manchuria occupied only 0.6 per cent. See the

<p class='c007'>It is noteworthy that Siberia, with a larger area than Manchuria,

displace Niu-chwang as an exporting centre. The latter is geographically
the nature outlet for the grain from the Liao Valley,
and, in winter, the handling of this product is apt to be done
more at Mukden than at Dalny, the latter becoming in that case
a mere port of transit. Moreover, mercantile customs differ so
much at Niu-chwang and Dalny that it is not possible that the
conservative Chinese merchants should readily transfer their
business from the one place to the other. See Tanabe’s conversation

<p class='c007'>Mr. James J. Hill, in a recent speech at Minneapolis, said
that his great system of transportation, by taking advantage of
all conditions, and by carrying full loads both ways, had been
able to make a freight rate of forty cents a hundred pounds of
flour to the Orient, or one mill per ton-mile. According to him,
the effect of the growing exportation of wheat from the Pacific
coast to the East seems to have caused an advance in its price
at Minneapolis of five to seven cents per bushel. In view of these
facts, the possible exclusion of American flour from Manchuria
would not be without serious effects, especially if we consider
Mr. Hill’s opinion that the success of Mr. Chamberlain’s financial
scheme would result in enabling Manitoba to supply all the
wheat needed in Great Britain, thus leaving in the United States
a large surplus of grain, for which other markets would have to
be developed. See the American <cite>Review of Reviews</cite> for February,

<p class='c007'>At Dalny, however, Russia has welcomed the coöperation of

No. 262 (March 15, 1903), p. 13. The reasons for this
modification at Dalny of the customary Russian policy are plain,
for the port must be developed as rapidly as possible before the
Russians can absolutely control its trade. Thus the importance
of Dalny as a trading port brings to conspicuous prominence the
universal contradiction of the Russian commercial policy in
East Asia. Russia would exclude other trading nations from
her possessions in order to control the trade, but is at the same
time unable to develop it without either the coöperation of other
people or some unnatural devices.</p>

when we remember that the Russian law of neutrality considers
food as among contraband goods, so that the supply of

henceforth completely closed, until the Russians evacuated Niu-chwang

when the Korean King was still living in the Russian Legation in
Seul. About May, 1903, after more than seven years’ inactivity,
the Russians began to cut timber on a large scale along the Yalu
River, and subsequently made extensive improvements at Yongampu
at the mouth of the river. The political features of this
event do not concern us here. See pp. <a href='#Page_263'>263</a>, <a href='#Page_289'>289</a> ff., <a href='#Page_318'>318</a> ff., below.</p>

the Island of Koji and the Korean coast, is said to be deep
and broad enough to hold the largest fleet, sheltered from winds
from all directions. Several islands with sufficiently wide passages
between them form a splendid gate to the bay, while the
western extremity of the latter may be walked across, when the
tide is low, from the Koji to the coast.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the Masampo reach or inlet, specifically, which is the
head of the gulf, “its entrance, five cables wide, named the Gate,
is perfectly free from dangers, and is available for all classes of
vessels. On either side are treeless hills, bare in winter, but in
summer covered with grass; these hills, near the entrance, slope
steeply to the water’s edge. The general depth over the reach is
seven fathoms, but it shallows gradually as the town of Masampo
is neared, until at one mile from the town the depth is
four fathoms.... Anchorage may be had anywhere in Masampo
reach, according to draught; a depth of three fathoms
being found at half a mile from the town, and six to seven fathoms
at two miles below it.”—The <cite>Sailing Directions for Japan,
Korea, and Adjacent Seas</cite>, published by the British Admiralty,

<p class='c007'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. It is remarkable how little the spirit of Japan’s policy, which
the writer has attempted to express in this sentence, is understood
among the people here. A vast majority of people, not
excluding recognized writers and speakers on the East, seem
to ascribe to Japan certain territorial designs, particularly in
Korea. It is not remembered that Japan was the first country to
recognize the independence of Korea, the cause of which also
cost Japan a war with China. The present war with Russia is
waged largely on the same issue, for it is to Japan’s vital interest
to keep Korea independent. From this it hardly follows that
Japan should occupy Korea in order not to allow her to fall into
the hands of another Power. If Korea is really unable to stand
on her feet, the solution of the difficulty does not, in Japan’s
view, consist in possessing her, but in making her independence
real by developing her resources and reorganizing and strengthening
her national institutions. It is in this work that Japan’s
assistance was offered and accepted. It would be as difficult for
any impartial student not to see the need of such assistance as to
confuse it with annexation. It would, however, be entirely legitimate
to regard the task as extremely difficult and dangerously
prone to abuse. Further, see pp. <a href='#Page_366'>366</a> ff., below.</p>

articles of the <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Tokio Nichi-Nichi Shimbun</span></cite> (Tokio Daily News),
a semi-official organ of the Japanese Government at the time,
as quoted in the <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Nisshin Sen Shi</span></cite> (history of the Japan-China
war, Tokio, 1894–5, 8 vols.), vol. viii. pp. 141–171. These articles
give a minute and careful account of the diplomacy of the
day, and may largely be relied upon as authentic.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r136'>136</a>. It will be remembered that Japan had in 1894 revised her
treaties with the Powers, and thereby freed herself from the yoke
of consular jurisdiction and placed the foreign residents within
her domain under the jurisdiction of her own law, and also
largely restored her tariff autonomy.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r138'>138</a>. To take only a few tangible instances, Japan’s national
budget grew more than three-fold during the ten years before
1903, her foreign trade in 1903 was 263% as large as it was in
1894, her private companies increased from less than 3000
in 1894 to 8600 in 1902, with a corresponding growth of their
authorized capital from less than 200 million to 1,226.7 million
<em>yen</em>, and her population itself has increased perhaps by 12%.
A decisive development has also taken place in both the internal
politics and the international relations of Japan.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f139'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r139'>139</a>. An attempt has been universally made during the present
war to explain the apparent contempt of death of the Japanese
soldier as due to his low estimate of human life, or else to his
fatalistic view of the world. It may be seriously doubted whether
these explanations are tenable. At least it may be said that in no
other case would the sons of Japan so fearlessly and cheerfully
face death. It is impossible to discover in them a less fear of
death than in other nations. Life is dear, but it is sacrificed to a
cause which is considered higher than life. It was the primary
lesson in the education of the <i><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">samurai</span></i> to choose death when it
saved honor and when life was selfish. This view of life has now
been transferred from the narrow sphere of the individual person
or fief to the large field of the entire nation, whose cause, it is
believed, represents the best postulates of human progress. It
would, perhaps, be legitimate to criticise the incidental abuse of
this feeling, or to question whether the same loyalty might not be
transferred to a still higher region than the state, but the subject
must first be understood by the critic.</p>

30, 1904), the Chinese Government had been paying the stipulated
4% interest for this sum to the French creditors, but the
Bank had never repaid the interest to China. Moreover, the
Niu-chwang branch of the Bank, since the Russians occupied
the port in August, 1900, had been receiving the returns of the
Chinese maritime customs there, which finally amounted to
about 5,000,000 <em>taels</em>. Neither the principal nor the interest of
this sum had been paid by the Bank to the Chinese Government.</p>

cannot for a moment be considered equivalent to the others
which have been cited. Not only is it silent about the contents of
the agreements, but also the “assent” of the Prince may be due
to some misunderstanding. In the same article, Dr. Morrison
goes on to say: “I have reason to believe that the original Russian
draft promised China protection only against Japan, but
was modified at the request of the Chinese to include protection
against aggression by all foreign Powers. China invoked its
provisions after Germany seized Kiao-chau, but Russia turned a
deaf ear.” This statement is again as vague as the reported text
of the treaty of alliance of 1896. It is to be regretted that the
writer did not explicitly state his “reason.”</p>

to the Chinese Government as soon as the line was in
running order. It will be remembered that the government was
responsible for the contribution of an equal amount of money to
the capital of the Russo-Chinese Bank. It is probable that the
money has been transferred from the Company to the Bank, so as
to make it pay two bills, the one after the other. It has already
been reported that the money was originally paid out of the
Russo-French loan of 1895. If this report is true, the whole arrangement

an article in the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kolonialzeitung</span></cite> of January 6, 1898, describing
the mineral resources of the province, and concluding that the
Power which possessed Kiao-chau would control the coal supply
in northern Chinese waters. See <cite>China, No. 1 (1898)</cite>, p. 21.
The same authority had shown years ago the advantageous
position of Kiao-chau.</p>

France, and Russia have taken maritime ports in the East, and

observe that when, in order to restore the balance of power in the
Gulf of Pechili, which had been disturbed by the lease of Port
Arthur by Russia, England demanded the lease of Wei-hai-Wei,
she took pains to explain to Germany that her acquisition of the
port, the meaning of which was purely military, would in no way
interfere with the German interests in Shan-tung, and that there
would be no attempt to make railway connections with Wei-hai-Wei.
An interesting diplomatic correspondence followed this
explanation, which it is hardly necessary to describe. What is
emphasized here is that England, in negotiating the lease of Wei-hai-Wei,
largely reciprocated the cordiality Germany had shown
in her occupation of Kiao-chau. See <cite>China, No. 1 (1899)</cite>, Nos.

the maritime and native customs, salt tax, and <em>likin</em>, as security;
(2) a railway from the Burmese frontier to the Yang-tsze valley;
(3) a guarantee against the cession of territory in the Yang-tsze

(5) the pledge that so long as the British trade with China was
larger than the trade of any other nation, the inspector-general
of customs should always be an Englishman; (6) a freer internal
navigation; etc. These terms seem to have been framed so
as to protect British interests in China strictly within the scope
of the most-favored-nation principle. The demand for the opening
of Talien-wan and Nanning strongly prejudiced England
against Russia and France, while the Burma-Yang-tsze Railway
was unpleasing to France, and the non-alienation of the river
valley was sometimes regarded by Russia as a counterpart of her
own claims beyond the Great Wall. The whole story of the loan

<p class='c007'><a href='#r227'>227</a>. The Russian Government soon had occasion to gauge the
strength of the British protest, for, on March 8, Sir N.
O’Conor made a striking statement to Count Muravieff, as will
be seen in the following report (<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></cite>, No. 108, O’Conor to Salisbury):
“I alluded, as no doubt his Excellency was aware, to
the junction of the Burmese and Chinese railway systems. This
demand became at once still more necessary and reasonable if
greater privileges of the same kind were accorded to Russia in
the Liao-tung Peninsula, as they had apparently already been
accorded in Manchuria. Count Muravieff did not, however,
respond to these remarks beyond saying that he supposed the
Burma-Chinese line would, in this case, descend to the valley
of the Yang-tsze.” The Count’s remark may be considered a
sufficient reply, when it is seen in connection with another
remark he made a few moments earlier. When Sir N. O’Conor
alluded to the objectionable features of leasing Port Arthur, the
Foreign Minister reminded him that British interests were principally
represented in the neighborhood of the Yang-tsze. Russia
would evade the British protest by turning England’s attention
to her own sphere, in which Russia had little interest, and would
not object to a British repetition there of Russia’s conduct in
Manchuria. Muravieff must have thought that O’Conor, by his
reference to the Burmese Railway, now voluntarily threw himself
into his net. Russia later succeeded in inducing England to
conclude the Anglo-Russian railway declaration of April 28,
1899, delimiting in a negative manner the railway spheres of the
two Powers in China, Russia pledging not to seek concessions
and not to obstruct those of the British in the Yang-tsze valley,
and England pledging similarly in regard to Russian concessions
beyond the Great Wall. (See <cite>China, No. 2 (1899)</cite>, No.
138.) The Russian Government naturally considered the conclusion
of this agreement as a diplomatic victory over the British,
and seemed to have interpreted its terms as implying that all
the territory beyond the Great Wall was the Russian sphere, not
only of railway concessions, but also of general interests and influence.
Already in May of the same year, M. Pavloff renewed
his demand at Peking for the concession of a Russian railway to
be built directly to the Chinese capital, thus even overreaching
the limit set in the British agreement of less than a fortnight
previous. See <cite>China, No. 1 (1900)</cite>, pp. 112, 116, 120, 129,

<p class='c007'>It should be said, in justice to Great Britain, that at first, when
the Chinese Government intimated toward the end of February
that they would lease Wei-hai-Wei to her if she would accept it,
Lord Salisbury considered such an offer premature, for his Government
“aimed at discouraging any alienation of Chinese territory.”—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></cite>,

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f242'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r242'>242</a>. Two other instances may here be cited to further illustrate
the policy of the British Government during this critical period
of time. (1) Soon after the appearance of Russian war-vessels at
Port Arthur, Admiral Buller, of the China station of the British
navy, arrived at Chemulpo with seven ships, on December 29,
and ordered the “Immortalité” and “Iphigenia” to proceed to
Port Arthur. The former was, on January 10, ordered to leave
for Chefu. The presence of the British boats created “a bad
impression” on Russia, which requested England to avoid dangers
of conflict in the Russian “sphere of influence.” The British
Government explained that the ships had been sent by the
Admiral without instruction from the Admiralty, and would soon
leave, “in ordinary course of cruising.” It was added, at the
same time, that British ships had a perfect right to proceed to
Port Arthur. It was reported at one time that the two boats had
been ordered away from Port Arthur under protest from Russia.—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></cite>,
Nos. 31, 48, 52, 63, 66, 68. (2) On March 8, Sir Claude
MacDonald was informed by the Tsung-li Yamên that the only
reason given by M. Pavloff for the demand of the lease of the
two ports was to “assist in protecting Manchuria against the
aggression of other Powers.” Probably England and Japan were
meant, and the Yamên was fully alive to the absurdity of this
pretext, but was unable to resist the Russian demands. It therefore
begged earnestly that the British Government would assist
it by giving a formal assurance to the Russian Government that
England had no designs on Manchuria. It does not seem to have
been thought necessary by the British Government to give such
an assurance. See <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></cite>, Nos. 100 and 109.</p>

to do so, Japan would have no objection to its being held

forces to fortify and defend it adequately. At the time when England
leased the port, she was hardly inclined to let financial considerations
thwart her effort to restore her prestige so abruptly
foreshadowed by that of Russia. In 1902, however, the lately
concluded Anglo-Japanese agreement of alliance rendered the
fortification of Wei-hai-Wei no longer necessary. See <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Tokushu

<p class='c007'><a href='#r263'>263</a>. It may reasonably be said that the meaning of the intervention
of Russia, France, and Germany, in 1895, in regard to
Japan’s claim upon the Liao-tung Peninsula may be gathered,
in a retroactive way, from Russia’s conduct in Manchuria since
1896. At any rate, M. Pavloff declared, in October, 1897, that
“the Russian Government intended that the provinces of China
bordering on the Russian frontier must not come under the influence
of any nation except Russia.”—<cite>China, No. 1 (1898)</cite>, p. 6.
This declaration throws light not only on the trans-Manchurian
railway concessions and the lease of ports, but also on Russia’s
action respecting the Northern Railway extension and the consequent
Anglo-Russian agreement of April, 1899. In May, 1898,
there were already 200 Russian soldiers in Kirin, and in December,
2000 in Port Arthur and Talien-wan, while many Cossacks
guarded railway construction, and many barracks were being
hurriedly built, so that there were sufficient indications even
before 1900 that Russia regarded Manchuria as her sphere of
influence.</p>

Writing on June 29 from St. Petersburg, Sir Charles Scott

near the Manchurian Railway, and it was rumored that

and had cut off telegraphic communications with Vladivostok.
“The Chinese Legation [at St. Petersburg] is much

by the allied forces. In each case the Emperor made a special

The various replies are highly instructive. It seems that

as yet discussed with other powers the circumstances to which
those principles might possibly apply.”—<cite>China, No. 1 (1901)</cite>,

deemed it “premature to forecast the means of bringing about

in China].”—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></cite>, No. 140. It is particularly remarkable

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to compare these “fundamental principles” of
Russia with the principles laid down in Secretary Hay’s circular
telegraph addressed to the Powers on July 3, or probably some
days before the Russian note: “... The purpose of the President
is, as it has been heretofore,” it said, “to act concurrently
with the other Powers, first, in opening up communication with
Peking and securing the American officials, missionaries, and
other Americans who are in danger; secondly, in affording all
protection everywhere in China to American life and property;
thirdly, in guarding and protecting all legitimate American interests;
and fourthly, in aiding to prevent a spread of the disorders
to the other provinces of the Empire and a recurrence of
such disorders. It is, of course, too early to forecast the means
of attaining this last result; but the policy of the Government
of the United States is to seek a solution which may bring about
permanent safety, and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial
and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to
friendly Powers by treaty and international law, and safeguard
for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with all
parts of the Chinese Empire.”—The 56th Congress, 2d Session,
<cite>House Documents</cite>, vol. i. p. 299. It will be observed that the
American note is not only probably earlier in date, but also
much wider in scope, than the Russian propositions, for the
former contains the open door principle, among others, which
receives no reference in the latter. It should be remembered,
however, that the American note was not a proposition to the
other Powers.</p>

“In the event of the Russians making any complaint of our having
concluded the Anglo-German Agreement without previously
consulting them, you should dwell on the fact that the conduct
and language of Russian officers in the Far East, in respect to the
Chinese railway from Niu-chwang to Peking, and the way in
which the property of British subjects on that railway has been
dealt with by the Russian military authorities, has caused much
perplexity to Her Majesty’s Government. The Russian Government
have given us many satisfactory assurances with respect to
their intentions in these matters, but the little attention paid to
the avowed policy of the Russian Government by officers on the
spot has deterred us from fuller communication.”—<cite>China,

between the two Powers when Wei-hai-Wei was leased to Great
Britain in 1898. There occurred in the East several affairs of
minor importance in which the British and Japanese authorities
acted with mutual good-will; e. g., the arrangement for a British

<p class='c007'><a href='#r399'>399</a>. Mr. Katō, Foreign Minister at Tokio at the time, remarked
later that even in matters about which the two Powers had not
exchanged their views, their Representatives at Peking acted in
such mutual sympathy that it was suspected that a secret understanding
must have existed between them.—<cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Tokushu Jōyaku</span></cite>,

<div class='footnote' id='f400'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r400'>400</a>. In this connection it was thought not improbable that Germany
herself might have informally suggested the feasibility of
a triple alliance between herself and Great Britain and Japan in
the same line as the Anglo-German Agreement, which Japan had
joined as a signatory. In his speech before the Reichstag, however,
Herr von Bülow declared, on March 3, that Germany was
not the father of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. At any rate, the
German suggestion, if there was one, never materialized, but
gave place to another and still more important form of agreement
in which the world-politics of the versatile Kaiser played
no part.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f401'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r401'>401</a>. The position which one of the elder statesmen out of office,
Marquis Itō, occupied in this diplomatic evolution, has been a
subject of much speculation. He was not only on his tour in
America and Europe when the Agreement was concluded, but
also had made efforts at St. Petersburg to come to an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entente</span></i>
with Russia. From this, it has even been charged that he was
opposed to an Agreement with Great Britain. It now appears,
however, that he had discussed the latter question with Premier
Katsura before he sailed for Europe, and that he proceeded
to St. Petersburg with a full authorization from the Government
to exchange views with Count Lamsdorff regarding Korea.
In the mean time, the Cabinet continued its negotiations with
Great Britain. Each must have kept the other well informed
of the progress of the respective negotiations, with this important
difference, however, that Marquis Itō apparently entertained
the view, which the Cabinet respected without accepting,
that a British alliance would be, not less desirable, but more
difficult of realization, than a Russian agreement concerning
Korea. Unexpectedly to the Marquis, his effort did not materialize
as well as he had hoped, while, on the other hand, it
seemed as if his significant presence in Russia had hastened the
hands of the jealous British Foreign Office, which now put its
seal upon the terms as agreed upon with rather unexpected
readiness.</p>

which says: “I have the honor to report that a considerable
town, to consist of some 300 cottages, of which about 100 have
already been built, is in course of construction on both sides of
the Russian railway to the immediate northwest of the city of
Liao-yang Chou. These cottages, which when completed will
occupy a large piece of land bought from the Chinese proprietors
by the Railway Company, are intended for the residence of
railway employees and of the artisans who will be engaged at the
cleaning and repairing shops to be established at this important
depot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“While this foreign town is growing outside, the Chinese Government
buildings inside the city of Liao-yang are being rapidly
evacuated, in many cases the only vestige of the Russian occupation
being a solitary sentry keeping guard over the property.
Russian troops are also being withdrawn from Liao-yang and
conveyed by rail to Port Arthur.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A more direct testimony came from the Russian diplomats,
probably M. Lessar himself, who, even so late as at the beginning
of September, 1903, or a month before the end of the stipulated
period for the complete evacuation of Manchuria, intimated
to Prince Ching that the reason for the delay of the actual
evacuation was “that the barracks for the railway guards were
not ready.”—<cite>China, No. 2 (1904)</cite>, No. 156.</p>

year 1902 that, contrary to the popular notion that Russia was
evacuating Manchuria, she was just beginning to consolidate her
influence in that region.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the number of the Russian troops left in Manchuria
after the first period of evacuation, we have the following
authoritative statement by Count Cassini, Russian Ambassador
to the United States: “Faithfully adhering to the terms of her
treaty with China respecting Manchuria, she [Russia] had withdrawn
the major portion of her troops from that province until
<em>between 60,000 and 70,000</em> only remained.”—The <cite>North American
Review</cite> for May, 1904, pp. 682–683. It is not clear whether
this number included the Russian soldiers stationed outside of
the Chinese quarters.</p>

certain interesting provisions, which the reader may compare
with those of the Manchurian railways. There occur two exclusive
measures, that none but Koreans and Japanese may hold
shares of the railway capital (Article 15), and that no other foreigners
shall reside within lands assigned for the depots (Article
5). The work should be begun within three years after the
signature of the contract, and be completed within ten years
hence (Article 10). After fifteen years of operation, the Korean
Government might purchase the entire line, and, if unable to do
so, the purchase would be postponed by periods of ten years
(Article 12). As soon as the Korean finances should admit, the
railway might be made a common work between the Koreans
and Japanese (Article 13). The laborers and the timber employed
in the construction should as far as possible be obtained
in Korea (Article 6). The lands assigned for the line and its
depots shall belong to the company only so long as it operates
the road, and the Korean Government should furnish no other
lands to the company (Articles 3 and 8). It should be added
that the Japanese Government guaranteed a six per cent. interest
for the capital of the company.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r590'>590</a>. After the opening of hostilities in February of the present
year, the Russian Foreign Office made a statement of Russia’s
case, in which it was said that, when the Japanese Government
proposed in August, 1903, to open the negotiations, “Russia consented,
and Viceroy Alexieff was charged to draw up a project
for a new understanding with Japan in coöperation with the
Russian Minister at Tokio....” See p. <a href='#Page_327'>327</a>, note 9, below.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r600'>600</a>. The Russian Government explained later, in the note delivered
on January 6, 1904, that the creation of a neutral zone was
“for the very purpose which the Imperial Japanese Government
had likewise in view, namely, ‘to eliminate everything that
might lead to misunderstandings in the future;’ a similar zone,
for example, existed between the Russian and British possessions
in Central Asia.”—<cite>N.-R.</cite>, No. 38.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to see, however, that <em>neutralization</em> is merely <em>common
appropriation</em> in a negative form, and might, like cases of the
latter, as in Primorsk and Sakhalien, result in <em>absorption</em> by one
of the two Powers between which the territory was neutralized.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r607'>607</a>. It is highly interesting that at this moment, when the Russian
Government was, on the one hand, negotiating with Japan,
and, on the other, proposing new demands upon China, the Russian
Ambassador at London intimated the desire of his Government
to come to an agreement with Great Britain regarding their
interest in China. It appears that Russia wished Great Britain
to declare Manchuria as outside of her sphere of interest, in
return for a similar declaration by Russia regarding the Yang-tsze
valley. Lord Lansdowne’s reply was characteristic. “I
repeated,” he wrote to Sir C. Scott, “that we should be glad to
arrive at one [i. e., an agreement with Russia], but that it must, of
course, include the Manchurian question. We could, however,
of course not come to terms unless we were fully informed as to
the intentions of the Russian Government [in Manchuria]. Count
Benckendorff again asked me whether, if we were satisfied upon
this point, we should be likely to <em>assist</em> in bringing about an
arrangement between the Russian and Chinese Governments. I
said that we should certainly make no secret of our concurrence,
if we were thoroughly satisfied. Meanwhile, however, I was
afraid that our attitude must remain observant and critical.”—<cite>China,
No. 2 (1904)</cite>, No. 142 (August 12). Cf. No. 139.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Russian Government could not have forgotten that Great
Britain had agreed with Japan, on January 30, 1902, that neither
of the two Powers should come to a separate understanding
with another Power regarding China or Korea without a full
and frank discussion between themselves.</p>

the venal politicians of Seul. Of these, two are given below,
which are not verifiable, but certainly interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yi Keun-thaik is said to have told the Emperor, late in December,
1903, that the following assurance had been given by the
Russian Representative: if the Korean refusal to open Wiju and
Yong-am-po to foreign trade should result in the mobilization
of Japanese forces, Russia would also dispatch troops against
them; in 1894, Korea erred when she relied on China, but Russia
was not a China, and might implicitly be relied upon.—The
<cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Kokumin</span></cite>, telegram, December 25.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, it is said, M. Pavloff remarked in the presence of the
Korean Emperor and his attendants: “The Koreans often rely
upon Japan, or else are afraid of her, but where in the world is
Japan?” Then he scanned a map through a pocket magnifier,
and said: “Oh, I find a tiny country called Japan in a corner of
the Pacific Ocean. My Russian Empire is the greatest country
on the globe, spreading over two continents. If Korea relies upon
our Empire, she will be as safe as in navigating a sea in a colossal
vessel. Should Japan object to it, our Russia would only have to
do thus.” Here, placing a few matches on his palm, he blew
them off.—The <cite><span lang="ja-latn" xml:lang="ja-latn">Kyōiku Jiron</span></cite>.</p>

1904:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last year, the Tokio Cabinet, under the pretext of establishing
the balance of power and a more settled order of things on
the shores of the Pacific, submitted to the Imperial Government
a proposal for a revision of the existing treaties <em>with Korea</em>. Russia
consented, and Viceroy Alexieff was charged to draw up a
project for a new understanding with Japan in coöperation with
the Russian Minister at Tokio, who was intrusted with the negotiations
with the Japanese Government. Although the exchange
of views with the Tokio Cabinet on this subject was of a friendly
character, Japanese social circles and the local and foreign press
attempted in every way to produce a warlike ferment among the
Japanese, and to drive the Government into an armed conflict
with Russia. Under the influence thereof, the <em>Tokio Cabinet
began to formulate greater and greater demands in the negotiations</em>,
at the same time taking most extensive measures to make the
country ready for war.” (The italics are the author’s.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. Mutual engagement to respect the independence and territorial
integrity of the Korean Empire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. Recognition by Russia of Japan’s preponderating interest

tending to improve her civil administration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. Engagement on the part of Russia not to oppose the development
of the industrial and commercial activities of Japan
in Korea, nor the adoption of measures for the protection of
those interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. Recognition by Russia of the right of Japan to send
troops to Korea for the purpose mentioned in the preceding
Article, or for the purpose of suppressing insurrections or disorders
liable to create international complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>“5. Mutual engagement not to make use of any part of the

<p class='c007'>“Having no objection to the amendments to Article 2 of the
Russian counter-proposals as proposed by the Imperial Japanese
Government, the Russian Government considers it necessary:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. To maintain the original wording of Article 5, which had
already been agreed to by the Imperial Japanese Government,
that is to say, ‘mutual engagement not to use any part of the territory
of Korea for strategical purposes, not to undertake on the
coasts of Korea any military works capable of menacing the
freedom of navigation in the Korean Straits.’ [The Japanese
Government had, as was pointed out by Baron Komura in the
dispatch No. 39, never agreed to the first half of Article 5.]</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. To maintain Article 6 concerning a neutral zone (this for
the very purpose which the Imperial Japanese Government has
likewise in view, that is to say, to eliminate everything that
might lead to misunderstanding in the future; a similar zone,
for example, exists between the Russian and British possessions
in Central Asia).</p>

<p class='c007'>“In case the above conditions are agreed to, the Russian Government
would be prepared to include in the projected agreement
an article of the following tenor:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Recognition by Japan of Manchuria and her littoral as
being outside her sphere of interests, whilst Russia, within the
limits of that province, will not impede Japan nor other Powers
in the enjoyment of the rights and privileges acquired by them
under existing treaties with China, exclusive of the establishment
of settlements.’”—<cite>N.-R.</cite>, No. 38.</p>

abroad declared to the Powers about the same time as the third
counter-note was delivered at Tokio, that Russia “had no intention
whatever of placing any obstacle in the way of the continued
enjoyment by foreign Powers of the rights acquired by them
[in Manchuria] in virtue of the treaties now in force.” The exclusion
of foreign settlements was not mentioned, but, judging
from the counter-note of January 6, was implied.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Count Benckendorff, Russian Ambassador at London,
handed the memorandum on January 8 to Lord Lansdowne, the
latter made characteristically blunt remarks, as will be seen
from the following dispatch from him to Sir C. Scott: “... I
could not help regretting that Russia should have found it impossible
to take even a single step in pursuance of the policy
which she has thus prescribed for herself [regarding the evacuation
of Manchuria]. I trusted that his Excellency would forgive
me for telling him frankly that, in this country, people were
looking for some concrete evidence of Russia’s intention to make
good her promises. An announcement, for example, that Niu-chwang
was to be evacuated at an early date would certainly
have a reassuring effect. So far as I was aware, there was no
local difficulty in the way.”—<cite>China, No. 2 (1904)</cite>, Nos. 162, 163.</p>

the opinion of the Imperial Japanese Government, a further
prolongation of the present state of things being calculated to
accentuate the gravity of the situation, it was their earnest hope
that they would be honored with an early reply, and that they
wished to know at what time they might expect to receive the
reply.”—No. 42. The probable nature of the forthcoming reply
was also inquired into, without success, even so late as January
30.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f661'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r661'>661</a>. No. 47. It is unnecessary to point out the various excuses
Count Lamsdorff presented for the delay. One of them was particularly
significant, that is, that the opinions of Viceroy Alexieff
and of the Cabinet Ministers at St. Petersburg had to be harmonized.—<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</span></cite></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f662'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r662'>662</a>. Mr. Kurino telegraphed to Baron Komura at 5.05 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span>,
February 5:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In compliance with the request of Count Lamsdorff, I
went to see him at 8 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, February 4. He told me that the
substance of the Russian answer had just been telegraphed to
Viceroy Alexieff, to be transmitted by him to Minister Rosen.
The Viceroy might happen to introduce some changes so as to
meet local circumstances; but in all probability, there would
be no such changes. The Count then stated, as his own opinion,
that:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Russia desired the principle of the independence and integrity
of Korea, and, at the same time, considered the free passage
of the Korean Straits necessary. Though Russia was willing
to make every possible concession, she did not desire to see
Korea utilized for strategic purposes against Russia. He also
believed it profitable, for the consolidation of good relations
with Japan, to establish by common accord a buffer region between
confines of direct influence and action of the two Powers
in the Far East.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The above was expressed by the Count entirely as his personal
opinion, and, though I cannot be positive, I think that the
substance of the Russian reply must probably be the same.”—<cite>N.-R.</cite>,
No. 50. Cf. p. 350, below.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be noted that this note from Mr. Kurino reached
Tokio at 5.15 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, or three hours and a quarter after the Japanese
notes severing relations had been sent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Count Cassini, in the following striking sentence, includes,
among the contents of the last Russian reply, a point which was
not in the least mentioned in Count Lamsdorff’s personal opinion
expressed to Mr. Kurino. M. Cassini says: “... However,
in another effort to bring the negotiations to a peaceful conclusion,
my country did all that dignity would permit, and <em>offered
to give assurances again that the sovereignty of the Emperor
of China in Manchuria would be recognized</em>.”—The <cite>North American
Review</cite> for May, 1904, p. 686.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f663'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r663'>663</a>. From the reply of the Japanese Government to the Russian
charge that Japan had broken peace and taken Russia by surprise.
See pp. <a href='#Page_352'>352</a>–353, below.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should not be forgotten, at the same time, that Japan had
all the while been taking precautionary measures in the most
careful and exhaustive manner, not only in military and naval
affairs, but also in other matters connected therewith. The difference
between the Russian and Japanese attitude may thus
be stated: Russia apparently played the three-fold game of
employing sharp diplomacy at Seul and Peking, of strengthening
her control over Manchuria and the Korean frontier, and of
endeavoring at once to intimidate Japan by vast warlike measures,
and to evade her overtures till she might be compelled to
acquiesce in the situation to be at length perfected by Russia;
Japan expressed her wishes in straightforward language, and
relied upon her negotiations with Russia, which she, in spite
of extremely trying circumstances, conducted with the utmost
cordiality and patience, but at the same time prepared for any
emergency in which the unconciliating attitude of Russia might
probably result. It will perhaps be always regretted by many
that the control of Russian diplomacy throughout the negotiations
rested in the hands of those who seemed to fail to grasp
the exact state of Japan’s mind in this greatest crisis of her
national existence.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f666'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r666'>666</a>. Mr. Kurino left St. Petersburg on the 10th, and the next day
saw the departure of Baron Rosen from Tokio. It was generally
believed that the former had once sincerely desired that a satisfactory
agreement between Russia and Japan should be effected.
As for Baron Rosen, every one surmised that the respected gentleman
was little responsible for the conduct of Russian diplomacy,
of which he was regarded as an unfortunate agent. From
a personal point of view, the sudden departure of both from their
posts had something tragic about it, and Baron Rosen’s situation
was deeply sympathized with by the Japanese people.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f670'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r670'>670</a>. The reports from Mr. Kurino do not agree with this statement
of Russia. According to the former, it was on January 26,
not the 25th, that Count Lamsdorff referred to the conference to
be held on the 28th. The date February 2 in this connection does
not appear till we reach Mr. Kurino’s dispatch of January 28.
Moreover, on January 30, the Count told him that he could not
tell him the exact date when the Russian reply would be sent.
See <cite>N.-R.</cite>, Nos. 43, 45, 47.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f671'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r671'>671</a>. This is evidently an error. The Count spoke to Mr. Kurino,
at 8 p. m., February 4, about the probable contents of the reply
purely as the former’s personal opinion. It was not an official
statement of the exact contents of the reply.—<cite>N.-R.</cite>, No. 50.
See p. <a href='#Page_340'>340</a>, above.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f672'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r672'>672</a>. This statement is incorrect and misleading. Referring to the
text of the Japanese note (pp. 342–344, above), it will be seen that
it did not say that the Japanese Government would break off the
negotiations because Russia had been evading a reply to the
Japanese proposals. A reference was made to the prolonged
delays of Russia before giving replies, but the note did not state
that the delays were the only reason, still less that the delay of
“a” reply—i. e., the last reply—was the ground, for the rupture
of negotiations.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
